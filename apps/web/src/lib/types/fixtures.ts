/**
 * Complete, type-checked fixtures for the shared domain types.
 *
 * Tests used to build partial objects and reach for `as Strategy` or
 * `as unknown as Strategy` to silence the missing fields. A cast turns off
 * excess-property checking too, so a fixture could set a field the type does
 * not have and nothing failed: five of them kept setting `isBuilt` long after
 * it was deleted from the backend and the generated types.
 *
 * Build from these instead. Overrides are checked, so a field that does not
 * exist is a compile error at the call site.
