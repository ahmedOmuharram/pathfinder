/**
 * The frontend used to declare its own operation vocabulary and cast it onto
 * the request type. Two values in that vocabulary had no backend counterpart -
 * `deleteEdge` and the `orphan-sibling` delete resolution - so both produced a
 * 422 on a gesture the canvas had already shown as successful.
 *
 * `toWireOperation` closes the hole at the type level for operation kinds.
 * Resolutions are strings inside an operation, so the compiler only checks
 * them against the generated enum if something asserts the relationship;
 * that is this file's job.
