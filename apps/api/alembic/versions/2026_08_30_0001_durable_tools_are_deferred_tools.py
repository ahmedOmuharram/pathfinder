"""Name the call a durable task answers, and flush every checkpoint.

A durable tool now defers its pydantic-ai call instead of interrupting the
graph, so ``background_tasks`` records the call its result answers. This
flushes every checkpoint, because the state shape gained the parked durable
call and a strict state does not read an older shape - not only the threads
that were interrupted. A flushed thread loses its graph state, its pending
approvals, its turn totals and a one-agent thread's message history, and
resumes from a fresh turn; conversations, the durable event log, messages,
strategies and background tasks are untouched.
