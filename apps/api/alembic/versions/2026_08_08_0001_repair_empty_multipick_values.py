"""Repair multi-pick values stored as the literal string "[]".

``MultiPickValue.values`` used to require at least one entry, so callers with
nothing selected degraded the empty list to the string ``"[]"``. That reached
vocabulary matching and WDK rejected it with
``Parameter '<name>' does not accept '[]'`` - on parameters whose own spec
sets ``allowEmptyValue=true``. The type now allows an empty list; rows written
before that still carry the bad value, which makes their step editor
unopenable without the read-path leniency that exists to tolerate it.
