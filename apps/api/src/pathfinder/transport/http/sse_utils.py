"""Shared helper for simple typed-event SSE streams (not conversation).

Used by experiment/sweep/seed progress streams. Conversation uses the
LangGraph stream-event pipeline; don't use this for chat.

The helper wraps any ``AsyncIterator[BaseModel]`` as a Starlette
``StreamingResponse`` emitting ``text/event-stream`` frames. Each yielded
model becomes one ``event: <name>\\ndata: <json>\\n\\n`` frame. A trailing
``data: [DONE]\\n\\n`` sentinel is always flushed in a ``finally`` block so
browsers (and the frontend ``streamTypedEvents`` consumer) can close cleanly
even when the producer raises mid-stream.

Event names may be homogeneous (``event_name="sweep_point"``) or derived
per event (``event_name=lambda e: e.type``) for heterogeneous streams.
