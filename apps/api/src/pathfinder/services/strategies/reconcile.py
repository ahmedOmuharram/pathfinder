"""WDK reconciliation: read live WDK state to self-heal local sync_state.

Local `wdk_step_ids` can drift from WDK reality after a partial push
failure or out-of-band edits on the WDK web UI. Before planning a new
push, intersect locally-tracked IDs with what WDK actually has so the
planner doesn't try to PATCH/RECREATE steps that no longer exist (or
worse, CREATE duplicates of steps it forgot were already pushed).
