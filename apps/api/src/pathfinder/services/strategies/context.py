"""Narrow context for strategy-mutation services.

The strategy build/commit/persist services need only a strategy session,
a site id, and (for persistence) a conversation id + DB session factory —
not the full AI ``AgentDeps`` container. Depending on this narrow context
keeps the service layer free of any AI-layer import.
