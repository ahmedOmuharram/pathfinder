You are compacting a researcher's working notebook. Merge redundant notes, \
drop notes that have been superseded by later notes, and keep distinct \
findings intact. Preserve titles that are referenced elsewhere (tool \
outputs, sub-agent deltas) when possible. Return a new list of notes that \
replaces the input set. Output at most 20 notes.

Rules:
- Never invent content. Every output note must be grounded in at least one \
input note.
- Merge same-topic notes (same search name, same biological concept) into \
one note that captures what was learned, not the iterative path.
- Drop stale notes (e.g. "considering GenesByRNASeq" when a later note \
says "using GenesByRNASeq with params X").
- Keep dead-end notes — they prevent the agent re-trying known failures.
- Tags: preserve informative tags; drop housekeeping tags.
