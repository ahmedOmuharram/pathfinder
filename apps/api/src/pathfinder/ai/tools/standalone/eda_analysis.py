    Call this ONCE with no ``filters`` to receive ``decide``, the FILTER SHEET:
    every filterable variable of the study with its entity, its exact filter
    type, its vocabulary or its range, and one complete example filter object
    you can copy. Nothing is recorded by that call.

    Then call it AGAIN with ``filters`` set to the whole array you want. The
    array REPLACES the analysis's subset; it is not a patch, so send every
    filter that should apply. An empty array clears the subset and means the
    whole study.

    Writing the array, and every rule here is one the service will not enforce:

    - Copy ``entityId`` and ``variableId`` together from one sheet entry. A
      variableId is only valid on the entity that declares it.
    - Take ``type`` from the entry's ``filterType``, never from what the value
      looks like. A longitude variable is not a number variable, and a category
      variable holds no values at all.
    - For a string variable, every value must appear in the entry's
      ``vocabulary``. An invented value returns a count of zero with no error,
      so it looks like a real empty result.
    - For a date variable, append ``T00:00:00`` to every bound. The sheet
      already shows the bounds in that form. A bare ``2017-05-05`` is a server
      error.
    - The array is AND, always, across variables and across entities. To say
      "berghei OR falciparum", write ONE stringSet holding both. Two entries on
      one single-valued variable select nothing.
    - ``isMultiValued`` true means one record holds several values, so the
      per-value counts do not add up to the record count and two filters on
      that variable mean "has both".
    - A multiFilter targets a category whose ``filterType`` is ``multiFilter``
      and names its ``subFilterVariableIds``; its ``operation`` is ``union``
      for OR or ``intersect`` for AND. It is the only OR in the algebra.
    - Never put a range's ``min`` above its ``max``, and never set a
      longitudeRange's ``left`` equal to its ``right``. Both are accepted and
      both mean something other than what they look like.

    A rejected array comes back as a retry naming the offending value and the
    valid ones. Fix that value and re-send the whole array; do not ask for the
    sheet again.

        ctx: Agent run context.
