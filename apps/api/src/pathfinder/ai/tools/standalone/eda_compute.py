    This compares two groups of samples and reports, per gene, an effect size
    and a p-value. It runs in the background: the turn ends cleanly, the
    researcher sees progress, and you are called again with the result when it
    finishes. That can take a minute or several.

    Use it when the question is a comparison - "up in febrile samples",
    "different between the mutant and the wild type", "responds to heat shock".

    Choosing the arguments, and describe_eda_study gives you all of them:

    - ``identifierVariable`` is the gene column, and it is the reserved
      variable ``VEUPATHDB_GENE_ID``.
    - ``valueVariable`` is the measurement column on the SAME entity. It is one
      of the reserved ids ``SEQUENCE_READ_COUNT``,
      ``SEQUENCE_READ_COUNT_SENSE``, ``SEQUENCE_READ_COUNT_ANTISENSE``,
      ``NORMALIZED_EXPRESSION`` or ``NORMALIZED_INTENSITY``.
    - ``comparatorVariable`` is the sample-level variable that separates the
      two groups, and it lives on an ANCESTOR entity of the expression data.
    - ``groupALabels`` is the reference group and ``groupBLabels`` is the
      comparison group. Every label must be a value in the comparator
      variable's vocabulary, and no label may be in both groups.
    - ``method`` is ``DESeq`` for raw counts and ``limma`` for normalized array
      data. ``DESeq2`` is not a value.

    The result carries the job's identity, the number of genes tested, and how
    many pass the default thresholds of effect size 1 and p-value 0.05, split
    into up and down. Tell the researcher those numbers, then use
    create_eda_step to export the ones that pass.

    Always write ``caption``. It is the one sentence printed under the plot,
    so it says what the comparison SHOWS in the researcher's terms - "Genes
    higher in febrile samples than in normal samples, per gene" - never an
    internal name and never a repeat of the numbers, which the figure already
    carries.

        ctx: Agent run context.
        identifier_variable: The gene column.
        value_variable: The measurement column, on the same entity.
        comparator_variable: The sample variable separating the groups.
