    Use this when the user chose to "try both" / sweep a parameter across
    values / ablate a step — instead of committing to one plan. Each variant
    runs as an anonymous WDK report (no step or strategy is created, so the
    user's workspace is untouched). Returns result sizes, pairwise overlap,
    and the genes unique to each variant, rendered as a comparison card.

    Provide at least two variants; each is one search with one set of
    parameter values, given a short human ``label`` (e.g. "2-fold",
    "5-fold"). This does NOT score or pick a winner; the user judges from
    the differences.

    If a winner matters, prefer ``compare_variants_scored``: given a control
    set (see ``build_control_set`` / ``list_control_sets``) it runs the same
    variants, scores each against known positives and negatives, and ranks
    them by MCC. Use this unscored tool when no control set exists or the
    user only wants to see how the results differ.
