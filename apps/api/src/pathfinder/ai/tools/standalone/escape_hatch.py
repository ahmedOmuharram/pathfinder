"""Exit-ramp tool for the constrained-toolset architecture.

Most planning/execution/verification tool args are constrained to the
universe discovery committed to. That keeps the model from hallucinating
identifiers — but it also means the model is **trapped** if it realises
mid-phase that it needs a search/parameter discovery missed. This tool is
the explicit out: an unconstrained ``search_name: str`` argument that
inspects the catalog inline AND logs a "constraint deviation" event so we
can see when downstream phases rely on it.

Usage from the model's POV: "the planner needs ``GenesByMicroarray`` but
discovery only selected ``GenesByGoTerm`` — call ``request_search_inspection
("GenesByMicroarray", "need microarray data for cross-condition check")``."

The tool runs the same ``get_search_overview`` flow discovery uses, so on
return ``discovered_searches`` is updated and downstream constrained tools
will accept the new search name on their next call.
