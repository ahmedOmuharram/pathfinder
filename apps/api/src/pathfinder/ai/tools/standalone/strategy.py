    Use this to build a strategy from nothing. To CHANGE a strategy that
    already exists, use `apply_operations` instead -- this replaces the whole
    graph, so it costs the entire strategy in tokens and overwrites anything
    the researcher edited in the meantime.

    Replacing a non-empty strategy requires `base_revision` (the `revision`
    from `get_strategy`), so a replacement is always something you chose
    rather than something that happened.

    The ENTIRE strategy is passed as a single `root` argument - a recursive
    StrategyStepNode where every combine has its inputs nested inside it.
    Do NOT put `primaryInput`, `secondaryInput`, `searchName`, or
    `parameters` at the top level of the tool args - they ONLY exist
    inside `root` (and inside nodes within `root`).

    Example - INTERSECT(UNION(A, B), C) where A, B, C are leaf searches::

        build_strategy(
            root={
                "operator": "INTERSECT",
                "primaryInput": {
                    "operator": "UNION",

                },
                "secondaryInput": {"searchName": "C", "parameters": {...}},
            },
            name="...",
        )

    To add a NEW set as a sibling of an existing tree, wrap the existing
    tree in a new combine: the existing tree becomes `primaryInput`, the
    new set becomes `secondaryInput`, and the new combine replaces `root`.
