"""Authoritative read of the strategy as it exists right now.

The Ledger holds counts from the last build, and the graph editor writes a
step's new value without writing the counts that value changes. This module
reads the graph the editor persisted and asks VEuPathDB for every count, so
the Lead can answer "what does my strategy return now?" with a fact rather
than a memory.
