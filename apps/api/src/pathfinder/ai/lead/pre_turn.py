"""PathFinder's pre-turn work: measure the recorded build against WDK, give a
strategy that has no spec one derived from what it already is, and brief the
turn on what moved since the thread last answered.

The user can edit the strategy between turns, in the graph editor or on the
site. WDK owns it, so only WDK can say what it holds now.
