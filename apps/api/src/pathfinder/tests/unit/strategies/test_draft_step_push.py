"""A newly added step with unfilled required params is a DRAFT, not an error.

Every graph operation commits to WDK, and push-time validation used to raise
``ValidationError`` when any step lacked a required parameter. The UI adds a
step first and collects parameters afterwards (the ortholog sheet literally
says "You can edit parameters after insertion", and the editor opens on the
new step), so that hard failure surfaced as a 422 on the very first click for
any search with a required parameter.

A step that has never reached WDK is allowed to sit incomplete. A step that
IS already in WDK must not silently regress into a draft: rewriting it with
missing params is a real error the user has to see.
