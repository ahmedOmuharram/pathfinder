"""The consult_user deferred tool: a blocking gate that asks the user design
questions at a genuine fork, then hands the answers back to the Lead so it can
re-run frame_problem with them. pydantic-ai paused on the first call, the user
answered in the carousel, the next POST carried the approval + a
data-user-question-answers payload, the backend extracted it into
state.user_question_answers, and the body now reads it.
