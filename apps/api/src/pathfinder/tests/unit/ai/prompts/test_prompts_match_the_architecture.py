"""The prompts are the model's only description of its own architecture.

A prompt naming a sub-agent or an output schema that no longer exists is not
a documentation problem: the model is instructed to return a schema it cannot
return, and to expect dispatches that cannot happen. These tests fail when
prose and code drift apart, which is how FRAME/BUILD/VERIFY left `scoping`,
`discovery` and `planning` behind in the base prompt.
