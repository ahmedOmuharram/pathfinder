"""The staged shape: one completed investigation, with the identity already gone.

An extract carries the request, the strategy it produced and the verification
verdict. It has no user field and no thread field, so the queue row is the only
place a staged case is associated with anybody, and promotion leaves that row
behind. Every text field is asserted redacted at construction: an extract that
still carries an identity pattern cannot be built at all.
