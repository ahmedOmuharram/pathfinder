"""First-pass redaction: the patterns that are never science.

An email address and a URL credential identify a person and never describe a
strategy, so both are removed before anything is staged. No rule reads digits:
in this domain a digit run is a gene count, a threshold or a WDK id, and a
false positive would silently corrupt the case. The full redaction is the
human curation step that promotes a case.
