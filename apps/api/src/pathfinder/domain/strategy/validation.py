"""Domain-native step validation types.

Defines ``StepValidation`` and ``StepValidationErrors`` — the domain
representation of WDK step/search/strategy validation state.  These are
pure data types (frozen, no I/O) that happen to match the shape returned
by the WDK REST API.

Previously defined in ``integrations.veupathdb.wdk_models`` as
``WDKValidation`` / ``WDKValidationErrors``, they were stranded in the
wrong layer.  Validation state ("is this step valid, and what are the
error messages?") is a domain concept, not an integration concern.

Moving them here lets ``SyncStateProtocol`` declare ``step_validations``
without importing from the integration layer, eliminating the isinstance
narrowing that was required at every read site.
