"""Detect that a recorded build no longer describes the live strategy.

The Lead answers questions from the Ledger, whose counts come from the last
``BuildOutcome``. Edits made outside the conversation — the graph editor, the
WDK web UI — change the strategy without touching that outcome, so cached
counts silently become wrong. Comparing recorded counts against a live read
turns that silence into an explicit warning.
