# The reversal

The first call here was to skip the migration plan's checkpoint TRUNCATE, on two grounds: it would destroy valid conversations, and old checkpoints degrade harmlessly because Pydantic ignores unknown keys.

The first ground was wrong. PathFinder has not shipped; there is no conversation history worth protecting, and Ahmed said so plainly: *"we can destroy convos it's fine ... i just dont want to have bandaided things and legacy-maintaining stuff when pathfinder hasnt even shipped yet once."*

The second ground was worse than wrong, because it was the bandaid. "Old checkpoints degrade harmlessly" is a description of a **compatibility shim**: `PipelineState` left `extra` at its permissive default, so any key the model does not declare was silently dropped. That is the same disease as an `as Step` cast. It does not just tolerate the dead five-phase shape; it means the **next** field rename half-lands, with writers setting a key readers quietly ignore, and nothing failing.

# What was done instead

- `PipelineState` sets `extra="forbid"`. A stale or misspelled field is a loud `ValidationError`.
- Migration `2026_08_09_0001` truncates the LangGraph checkpoint tables so no pre-FBV checkpoint can meet the strict model. In-flight conversations resume from a fresh turn.

Strictness was verified as viable before committing to it: LangGraph injects no keys of its own (41 graph tests and 17 checkpointer round-trip tests pass under `forbid`; the only failures were the three compatibility tests written the turn before, which now assert rejection instead).

Confirmed on a live turn after the migration: FRAME to BUILD to VERIFY on plasmodb, strategy `330519913`, 609 signal-peptide genes intersected with 1,649 transmembrane genes to give 326.

# The general rule

Before shipping, prefer the loud failure. A permissive default that lets a dead shape load is not robustness, it is a second source of truth with no owner.

# Anchor

`ConfigDict(extra="forbid")` on `PipelineState` and migration `2026_08_09_0001`. Guarded by `TestCheckpointsFromBeforeTheFbvFlip` in `tests/unit/ai/graph/test_state.py`, which asserts a pre-flip payload and a typo'd field name both raise.
