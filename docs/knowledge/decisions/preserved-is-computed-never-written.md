title: A claim that a criterion was preserved is computed from the two specs, never written by a model
description: An edit turn compares the spec it started from against the spec it produced, and a criterion that left the spec without a declared drop is a ModelRetry. The Lead's "the rest is unchanged" sentence is written from that comparison and from nothing else.

# The decision

`StrategyDomainState` carries `spec_before_turn`, a deep copy of the spec as
the pre-turn hook found it. `domain/strategy/spec_diff.py::diff_specs` compares
it against the spec the turn produced and reports one `CriterionChange` per
criterion: `kept`, `changed`, `added` or `dropped`.

Two consequences follow, and both are enforced in code rather than in a prompt:

1. `FrameResult` carries `changes`, the pass's own account of an edit. In
   `run_frame`, a criterion the computed diff reports `dropped` that the
   account does not declare `dropped`, and a criterion the account declares
   `kept` whose bound values moved, are both a `ModelRetry`.
2. The ledger's `FrameSection` exposes the diff as a computed field, derived
   from the same two specs. The Lead's instructions say a preservation claim is
   written from `ledger.frame.diff` and from nothing else.

`spec_before_turn` is deep-copied twice on purpose: once by the pre-turn hook,
and once again where `AgentToolState.operational_spec_draft` is seeded, so a
sub-agent's tools cannot mutate the record of what the turn started with.

# The alternative that was rejected

**Tell the model to preserve the rest, and trust the reply.** That is what the
product did. A measured run asked to change one filter and keep the rest, came
back with two of three criteria, and said the rest was preserved; a second run
narrowed a "kept" organism from the genus to one strain, because a kept
criterion was re-bound from its own 60-character label and every unstated
parameter was re-derived from that sentence. A prompt cannot make a claim true
after the fact, and nothing existed that could tell the claim was false.

**Have the model emit the diff and use it as the diff.** Rejected for the same
reason: the account and the state would then be the same object, and a wrong
account would be self-certifying. The model's `changes` is only ever an input
to a check against the computed comparison.

# What it costs

An edit turn can now fail a dispatch on a well-formed spec, when the account
does not match. That is deliberate: the retry names the criterion id and its
text, so the pass has what it needs to correct itself, and a refusal the user
sees is cheaper than a strategy that lost a filter silently.

The entry spec is kept out of the ledger's wire payload (`Field(exclude=True)`),
so the diff reaches the frontend without a second whole spec on every chunk.
