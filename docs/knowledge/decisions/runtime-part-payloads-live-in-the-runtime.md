title: The runtime's part payloads live in the runtime, so the package builds alone
description: The three durable-task payloads and TurnUsage moved from pathfinder-shared into assistant_core/conversation/stream_parts/, and assistant-core dropped its pathfinder-shared dependency. Publishing pathfinder-shared as a second distribution was rejected, because it has no second consumer and would make a host install PathFinder's product models to run a turn.

# What was decided

`assistant-core` declares no dependency on `pathfinder-shared`. The two modules
it read are payload declarations for parts the runtime itself emits, so they
are the runtime's: `BackgroundTaskStarted`, `TaskProgress` and `TaskCompleted`
are now `assistant_core/conversation/stream_parts/task_parts.py`, and
`TurnUsage` is `.../stream_parts/turn_usage.py`. The class names did not
change, because `PROTOCOL.md` names them and the OpenAPI schema index
publishes them.

They rebased from `shared_py.pydantic_base.CamelModel` onto
`assistant_core.platform.pydantic_base.CamelModel`. The two bases differ by one
key, `extra="ignore"`, which is Pydantic's own default, so the wire behaviour
and the published schema are unchanged.

`apps/api` keeps its direct `pathfinder-shared` dependency. The models that
name a gene, a strategy or an enrichment stay there.

# What was rejected

**Publishing `pathfinder-shared` as a second distribution.** It is the smaller
edit: leave the modules, add a build target. It was rejected because the
package has no second consumer and its remaining contents are PathFinder's
product parts. A host that wants to run a turn would install a distribution of
gene-set and strategy payloads to get four models it does emit, and the runtime
would carry the product's release cadence.

**A re-export shim in `shared_py`.** Rejected on the no-backwards-compat rule.
Nothing outside the runtime imported either module, so the move has no
migration cost to defer.

# What the move cost

The payload modules could not go under `conversation/stream_parts/` while that
package's `__init__.py` built the registry, because
`graph/stream_events.py` constructs `TaskProgress` and `TaskCompleted`, and
`core_parts.py` reads six payload classes back out of `graph/stream_events.py`.
Importing `assistant_core.graph.stream_events` first would run the package
`__init__`, which would re-enter a module that is half executed, and the second
import fails with a partially initialized module.

So `__init__.py` imports nothing and `STREAM_PARTS` lives in `core_parts.py`
beside the registrations it holds. A package that runs imports on load cannot
hold a module that its own importers need, and the failure depends on which
module a process reaches first, which is the worst kind.

# What would falsify this

`cd packages/assistant-core && uv build`, then installing the wheel into a
venv with no path dependencies and importing
`assistant_core.graph.stream_events`: the day that needs `shared_py`, this is
gone. `tests/unit/test_package_boundary.py` fails if any module under
`assistant_core` imports `shared_py`, and pins the two payload modules to the
model library alone.
