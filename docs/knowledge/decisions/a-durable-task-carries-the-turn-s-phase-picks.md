title: A durable task row carries the deferring turn's phase picks, so an override stays request-scoped
description: background_tasks gains a phase_overrides JSONB column, written from a per-turn context variable at deferral and read back when the worker opens the completion turn. Persisting the picks on the conversation was rejected, because it would turn a per-request override into a thread setting.

# What was decided

`POST /api/v1/chat` carries `phaseModels` and `phaseReasoning`, and
`ChatRequestBody` validates the roles against `PhaseRole` and the model ids
against the catalog. `run_turn` publishes the validated pair on
`phase_overrides_ctx` (`platform/context.py`) for the length of the turn.
`create_background_task` reads it and stores it on the new
`background_tasks.phase_overrides` column (migration `2026_08_30_0002`).
`jobs/runner.py::_completion_body` reads the row back and rebuilds the
completion turn's `ChatRequestBody` from it, so `TurnContextRequest` receives
the same picks the suspending turn ran under.

The picks travel by context variable rather than by argument because the
deferring caller is `@durable_tool`, which sits under `pathfinder.ai.tools`
and may not import persistence; the same reason `veupathdb_auth_token_ctx`
carries the request's WDK token into a tool.

The value is stored as a plain JSON object. `PhaseRole` lives under
`pathfinder.ai`, and persistence may not import it, so the roles are typed on
the way in and on the way out and the column holds what both ends agree on.

# What was rejected

**Persisting the picks on the conversation.** Every turn on the thread would
then read one set, and the completion turn would need no lookup. It was
rejected because it changes what a per-request override means: a body field
that today applies to one turn would silently become a thread setting, and a
researcher who pins a model for one question would keep paying for it on every
later question. The defect is that a request's picks do not reach the turn
that finishes the request's work, and the row that already represents that
work is where they belong.

**Reading the picks from the checkpoint.** The parked state is written by the
runtime package, which names no phase and no role. Putting a PathFinder
concept in `TurnState` to solve a PathFinder wiring problem inverts the
layering the runtime split established.

# The consequence, stated

Both halves of one investigation resolve the same model and the same reasoning
effort, so a per-phase comparison is not silently mixed across two models. A
task deferred before the column existed reads the empty map and its completion
turn resolves the configured tier, which is what it ran under. A model id that
leaves the catalog while a task is in flight fails the completion turn, and
`_safe_completion_turn` records that failure on the task row rather than
answering under a model nobody picked.
