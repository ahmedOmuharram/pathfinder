## 2026-08-31

* **The lead closed the fork/revert program.** The journey's turn 4 now
  asserts the build refusal it really gets (it had passed over a verification
  that never ran), a `build-refusal` spec pins the refusal end to end with a
  byte-equal AST, and the full affected e2e set - thread surgery, auto-build,
  execution phase, strategy overhaul, fork, branch switch, complex edit, the
  drug-targets journey - ran 39 of 39 green with no retries on the production
  e2e stack carrying the revert-materializes and binding-history contracts.
  The backlog is empty.

* **A revert materializes what it restores, and the EDA binding follows the
  thread's own log.** The last two invariants the case matrix filed rather
  than fixed are closed.

  A revert restored a snapshot by writing it back verbatim, so a revert inside
  a branch left a plan: `copy_prefix` writes a branch's snapshots with no WDK
  id, and the twig that had held a strategy id and four step ids of its own
  came out of the revert with `wdk_strategy_id = None` and no step ids at all.
  The revert path now adopts the snapshot through the same
  `materialize_strategy_snapshot` a branch uses, so the tree is pushed again
  and the thread owns the ids WDK answers with: the deleted turns may have
  edited the steps the snapshot names, so a fresh push is the only honest
  answer on an unbranched thread too. That makes a revert a WDK write, and
  `POST /conversations/{id}/revert-to-message` now carries the same
  `require_registered_wdk_identity` the branch route declares. A stopped turn
  still restores its pre-turn snapshot as recorded, because it is undoing
  writes made against those same steps.

  Neither branch nor revert read `conversation_analyses`, so a branch of a
  thread with a study open showed the study's turns and no study, and a revert
  past the turn that opened a study kept the study. The binding has no history
  of its own and cannot grow one from a row that is replaced in place, but the
  thread's log already records every binding state: a
  `data-eda.analysis-state` part carries the dataset, the analysis, the display
  name and the whole filter array, and the log is cut by a revert and copied by
  a branch. `services/eda/thread_surgery.py` reads the newest surviving part
  and puts the binding where it says: a branch creates an analysis of its own
  from the recorded descriptor, and a revert unbinds, refilters or rebinds in
  the four cases the invariants doc tabulates. Measured while deciding the
  rebind rule: nothing in the application calls the analyses client's
  `DELETE`, so a rebind normally finds the recorded document still on the
  service and only a `404` makes it create one. The EDA tab's own route emits
  no part, so a revert reads before the cut whether the log ever recorded a
  binding and unbinds only when it did, the same shape the strategy uses for a
  thread that predates the revision store. A refusal from the study service is
  logged and swallowed on both paths, because a document nobody can reach must
  not cost the user a branch or a revert.

* **The mock Lead now reads `build_strategy`'s refusal.** The deterministic
  script's build arc was a fixed `classify -> frame -> build -> verify ->
  final_result` list, so a second build on a thread that already had a strategy
  marched past the refusal and answered "Verified end-to-end." over an
  unchanged strategy: the one lane where a spec can watch a refusal reach the
  user could not tell a refused build from a built one. The arc now branches on
  the refusal it was given: `retry_prompt_parts` in the scripted-model
  machinery hands the script the `RetryPromptPart` a tool raised, the way
  `tool_return_parts` hands it the returns. A refused build ends the turn
  after `build_strategy` with prose that names `edit_strategy` and says nothing
  was built. A unit pin asserts the mock's marker is a substring of the real
  `build_would_replace_the_strategy` message, so the two cannot drift.

* **check:generated can fail now.** The generated tree is untracked (the
  repository index holds only the three hand-written shared-ts sources), so
  the script's exit-code diff of `src/generated` compared nothing against
  nothing and the CI job passed unconditionally. The honest invariant for
  untracked output is that the committed spec generates types that compile:
  the script is now `kubb && tsc --noEmit`. Drift between the app and the
  committed spec stays gated by the api lint job's openapi check, and every
  CI web job already regenerates the types from source (`setup-web`).

* **Branch and revert have a written case matrix, and holding it to the matrix
  found four defects.** `conventions/thread-surgery-invariants.md` states nine
  branch invariants and seven revert invariants as one testable sentence each,
  every sentence naming the test that goes red when it stops holding. Writing
  the tests first turned four sentences red.

  A copied log row was stamped with the moment of the branch while its message
  kept its source time, so the first revert inside a branch deleted every chunk
  of the turns it kept: the branch held its messages and rendered them empty.
  Copied notes had the same stamp and were also copied whole, so a branch held
  notes about work it never did. Both copies now keep their source's time, and
  the notes are cut at the anchor like the log.

  A branch of a branch opened on a plan with no WDK strategy, because the push
  was decided by the snapshot row's own WDK id and a branch's copied history
  carries none. The decision now reads the tree: every snapshot that holds one
  is pushed, and a WDK refusal still leaves the branch holding the plan. The
  conditional went with it.

  A branch inherited its source's `gene_set_id` while owning a new WDK
  strategy, so the branch's first build called `resync_strategy` on the
  parent's saved gene set and replaced its membership. The branch now starts
  unlinked and imports a set of its own; `experiment_id`, which is read and
  never written, still carries.

  Two gaps are filed rather than patched, both because the fix moves a contract:
  a revert inside a branch restores a plan (pushing would need the revert
  route's identity contract, which the fork route has and it does not), and
  thread surgery does not touch the EDA binding (the binding has no history to
  read, and `bind` leaves `created_at` at the first bind).

  The model-history cases are measured rather than argued: a scripted model
  records the messages each run is handed, and a turn on the branched or
  reverted thread must show the pre-anchor tool call and not the post-anchor
  one. Both go red when the checkpoint cutoff is removed.

* **Branching and reverting are driven in the browser, eight journeys wide.**
  `e2e/feature/thread-surgery/` runs real turns through the deterministic mock
  and asserts the surfaces a researcher reads: a branch taken at the first turn
  holds exactly the pre-anchor turns; a branch of a branch carries message ids
  no ancestor shares and reverts on its own; a turn on a branch answers from the
  Ledger it inherited and adds no sub-agent run; a branch taken at an old
  message carries that message's organism and a WDK strategy of its own; a
  revert truncates in place and puts the organism back; the reverted thread
  carries on and the deleted turns stay gone after a reload; a second revert to
  an already-deleted message is answered 204 and the dialog shows no error; and a
  branch of a thread with a study open opens an analysis of its own while the
  parent keeps its subset.

  Three harness additions carry them: `ChatPage.branchFromAssistantReply` reads
  the fork response for the id it navigates to (the route already named a
  conversation, so waiting for the pattern returned the id it was leaving),
  `openEditDialog`/`confirmRevert` drive the branch-or-revert dialog on a
  `user-edit-composer` testid, and `sendTurn`/`awaitTurn` give every turn one
  budget that covers its wait for a free worker slot. The script gained one arc:
  a recall request reads a Ledger section and answers with it, dispatching no
  sub-agent, which is what makes "the model sees the branch's history" a
  measurable claim - the Lead's run is handed no prior-turn messages at all, so
  the Ledger is the only thing a branch can inherit.

* **The lead closed the multi-durable follow-ups.** CLAUDE.md's durable
  paragraph now states the durable_calls list and the last-arrival gate; the
  frozen durable acceptance reads `task_ids` and the scalar compat property
  is gone; the serialize-spec allowlist names the state card's change digest
  (a comparison key, not an analysis document).

* **A model step that calls two durable tools is answered once, for both
  calls.** The park recorded one durable call of the step, so a run that owed
  results for two tasks was resumed with one and pydantic-ai refused the
  turn: `Tool call results need to be provided for all deferred tool calls`.
  `PendingDurableCall` now carries a `durable_calls` list (call id, tool, args,
  task, registered tool name), `_park_run` and `pending_durable_call` record
  every deferred call of the step, and `durable_tool_results` answers each one
  with its own task's result. The worker stores each result on its row and
  opens the completion turn only when the last task of the parked step has
  reported; earlier arrivals write their `data-task-completed` and stop, and
  the turn settles every row it answered. `2026_08_31_0001` flushes the
  checkpoints, PROTOCOL 1.5.3 states the several-task gap, and the thread's
  "View result" link now names only content written after the outcome.

* **The model captions its own plots, and the caption sits under the
  figure.** `EdaSubsetPreviewPart` and `EdaVizPart` gained `caption`, written
  by `preview_eda_subset` and `run_eda_compute` (the compute's rides the
  durable job's args to `_announce_volcano`) and asked for by the Lead's EDA
  loop. A part that carries one renders `Figure N. <caption> (<study> -
  <numbers>).`; a part without one keeps `Figure N. <study> - <numbers>.`, so
  the recorded acceptance turn's captions are unchanged. `Figure` gained
  `footer`, and both plots moved their readouts and disclosures into it, so
  the order is title, plot, caption, readouts, disclosures. The volcano draws
  expanded, with the collapse control kept.

* **The Lead searches for itself.** `web_search` and `literature_search`
  were registered only in the FRAME and VERIFY toolsets, so the assistant
  could ground a claim only by dispatching a sub-agent. Both are now Lead
  tools (the same thin `agent_deps_for` wrapping `clear_strategy` uses),
  never hidden by the intent gate, pinned in `test_lead_research_tools.py`
  and the seam's tool list.

* **The rail's active section is a no-op.** Clicking the Chat icon while a
  conversation was open navigated to the bare draft route and dropped the
  thread; a section link whose section is already active now prevents the
  navigation, for all three rail items, pinned in `AppNavRail.test.tsx`.

* **The gene-id disclosure copies its list.** A copy icon beside the
  "Gene ids (N)" summary writes every selected id to the clipboard as a
  comma-separated list - all of them, not the twelve the readout prints -
  without toggling the disclosure, and flips to a check while it confirms.

* **The lead closed the paper-figures pass.** The frozen figures acceptance
  now pins the numbered captions verbatim, and the subset preview's body lost
  its entity list - the same self-repetition the state card lost, satisfied
  by the caption alone (both previously-cited pins read the caption's text).

* **The data plots caption themselves like a paper, and their long lists sit
  behind a disclosure.** The subset histogram and the volcano now carry a
  centered, italic caption prefixed `Figure N.`, numbered across both plot
  kinds in thread order by a client-side reader (`figureNumbers.ts`, beside
  `analysisStateParts.ts`); `Figure` gained `numbered` and `figureNumber`, and
  a plot the thread cannot number keeps the plain left caption. The recorded
  acceptance turn reads `Figure 1. Heat shock response in sensitive mutants
  (LRR5, DHC) - 6 of 12 Sample, 6 values.` and `Figure 2. ... - 1,543 of 5,511
  genes retained.` The 28 per-bin lines and the volcano's gene ids moved into
  native `<details>` (`Bin counts`, `Gene ids (N)`), closed on first paint; the
  coverage line joins them unless the distribution reports missing cases, and
  the multivalued warning and the selection readout stay visible. The study
  card stopped restating its own caption: its body is the analysis name, the
  filter chips and the computation count, and the entity counts appear once.

* **One study card per analysis, and the plots name their study.** The
  thread now keeps only the NEWEST analysis-state card for an analysis; an
  older statement yields to it on replay and live (reader rule in
  `analysisStateParts.ts`). The "Open study" button rides the title row
  (`Figure` gained an `action` slot) instead of its own line. The subset
  histogram and the volcano caption themselves with the study's display
  name, read off the thread's own state parts, so a plot keeps its context
  when the card above it has moved on.

* **The subset histogram has a plot area again.** The chat card drew its
  distribution at 72px while the chart's grid reserves 64px for axes, so the
  bars lived in 8 pixels. The height is 220, matching the collapsed volcano,
  and a pin holds it at 160 or more.

* **The model pill is gone; the turn's numbers ride the trace.** The badge at
  the top of an assistant message read `OpenAI - gpt-5.6-luna - 41.8K, $0.01`,
  which was the Lead's own spend and never the turn's, so the one number a
  reader saw was the wrong one. `ModelBadge` is deleted. The trace's summary
  row now carries a right-aligned `trace-usage` line, still behind the
  `showTokenUsage` flag: the bare model name from `data-lead-usage`, then
  `formatUsage` over the Lead's tokens and cost plus every
  `data-sub-agent-call` the message carries - the sum the wire reports as the
  turn total. The recorded acceptance turn reads `gpt-5.6-luna - 54.1K, $0.02`
  where the pill read `41.8K, $0.01`. `data-turn-usage` could not be the
  source: the chunk is transient, so neither the AI SDK nor `reduceSnapshot`
  ever puts it on a message part. The consult recap is headed "Your answers"
  and lays each pair out as `Q:` then `A:`, one block gap apart.

* **The thread has one vertical rhythm and no rules.** Spacing between a
  message's blocks, between messages, and between fan-out lanes is the one
  `THREAD_BLOCK_GAP` token on the flex containers; the cards' outer margins
  and the figure hairline are gone, with a source-reading guard
  (`threadRhythm.test.ts`) that fails on any `my-*` or `border-t`/`border-b`
  returning to thread content. The frozen figures acceptance now pins a
  classless figure. The vendored `MessageToolbar`/`MessageAttachment(s)`
  exports nothing rendered are deleted.

* **One paragraph rhythm in the thread, and no dividers.** Blocks inside a
  message and the messages themselves were spaced by eight different values -
  `gap-8` between messages, `gap-2` between a message's blocks, and `my-2`,
  `my-3`, `my-4` and `my-6` on the trace, the task rows, the consult cards,
  the notices and every figure - so a figure sat 24 px from its neighbour and
  a task row 8 px from its. One owner now holds the vertical rhythm:
  `THREAD_BLOCK_GAP` in `lib/components/thread/rhythm.ts`, applied by
  `MessageContent` between a message's blocks and by `ConversationContent`
  between messages. Every block in the thread sets no outer vertical margin,
  and `Figure` lost the `border-t border-border/60` rule that separated one
  typed result from the next. `threadRhythm.test.ts` reads the thread's own
  sources and fails on any `my-*` or any `border-t`/`border-b` under
  `features/conversation/content/` and `lib/components/thread/`, so neither
  can come back. Structural chrome outside the message flow - the composer's
  top border, the rail and the trace's indent rail - is unchanged.

* **The study card repeats only when it changed, and the strategy update is
  a titled card.** Every `open_eda_analysis` and `set_eda_filters` call put
  the full analysis-state card on the thread, and the state's `revision`
  bumps on every mutation, so a user saw the same "No filters yet, 12 of 12
  Sample" block three times in one arc. The tools now emit the card only when
  it would read differently (`analysis_state_chunks_if_changed`, a digest on
  the pipeline state that leaves out `revision` and the raw `filters`), and
  the chunk carries the analysis id so repeats inside one message reconcile.
  A compute's completion still announces its own state (it changed). The
  `data-graph-snapshot` figure rendered a bare "1 step, 1,543 genes" line
  with no title; it now reads "Strategy updated" above the counts.

* **Three findings from the user's first session on the finished build.**
  Opening the site logged `getPrivacySettings: 401`: the eval-data notice
  fired its privacy read in the same render that starts the token refresh,
  so the read raced the cookie mint; the query now waits for the refresh to
  settle and for a signed-in status, and an unauthenticated visitor is never
  asked. The turn trace opened and closed by itself as work started and
  settled: its expanded state now belongs to the reader - open when it mounts
  mid-run, closed when it mounts settled, and after that only the toggle
  moves it. The consult card ("Questions you answered") rendered at the end
  of the message rather than in the flow: `tool-consult_user` now renders its
  card where the part sits, through the same registry every other part uses,
  and nothing else is appended after a message's parts except the turn-status
  notices.

* **A tool's prose names its parameters as the schema spells them.** The
  final live arc carried one `tool-input-error`: `create_eda_step` refused
  `effectSizeThreshold`, `significanceThreshold` and `effectDirection` as
  extra fields - names the tool's own docstring and retry messages had
  taught, in camelCase, while the schema declares snake_case. The prose now
  uses the declared names, and a pin asserts the module contains no camel
  form of them and that the docstring names all three declared parameters.
  The lead ruled the single self-corrected retry within tolerance once this
  guard landed: the error never reached the user, and the arc ended verified
  at 1,543 with the prose quoting the digest.

* **Insert-saved dropped an edit committed while it read WDK, and spliced the
  saved strategy onto itself when the target step was the root.**
  `POST /conversations/{id}/insert-saved` read the stored AST, read and cloned
  a saved WDK strategy, and only then wrote the whole tree back.
  `test_an_insert_saved_and_a_param_edit_both_land` parks the insert inside the
  saved-strategy read while a parameter edit commits: the persisted
  `text_expression` came back `kinase`, not the committed `phosphatase`.
  `insert_saved` now takes `strategy_write_lock` before its read, and
  `_record_consumer` joins that transaction through the shared
  `write_lock.py::strategy_write_scope` instead of opening a second session
  against the row the caller's transaction already holds, which is what
  deadlocked. The same test found a second fault: `_build_new_root` added the
  new combine to the graph before it looked up the target step's parent, so the
  combine answered as its own parent, `primary_input_id` pointed at itself, and
  a root-target insert persisted the pre-insert tree with the consumer already
  recorded - `['GenesByText', 'GenesByGoTerm', '__combine__']` and
  `imported=[7777]` on a solo run. The parent is now read before the combine
  joins the graph; `tests/unit/services/strategies/test_insert_saved_splice.py`
  covers a root target and a target below the root.

* **A cancel test still encoded the pre-thread heartbeat window.**
  `test_stop_on_a_starved_but_live_worker_only_asks` staged a heartbeat aged
  153 s and asserted the job stayed `doing`; with
  `worker_dead_heartbeat_seconds` at 60 the job came back `failed`. The staged
  ages now read `worker_dead_heartbeat_seconds` and
  `worker_heartbeat_interval_seconds`, so the starved case sits one beat inside
  the window and the dead case ten windows past it, and the test asserts the
  starved age is inside the window before it stages it. The stale "five to six
  minutes" in `jobs/maintenance.py::release_stalled_jobs` is now the one to two
  minutes [the decision](decisions/a-dead-worker-fails-its-turn-by-heartbeat.md)
  already states.

* **Two overlapping edits on one thread each wrote a whole tree built from the
  same base, so one of them was dropped.** `POST /operations` read
  `conversation_strategies.strategy_ast`, edited the tree in memory, pushed to
  WDK, and only then took the per-thread advisory lock for the write, so a
  second operation that read before the first committed wrote its own tree over
  it. Measured both ways in
  `tests/integration/services/conversations/test_concurrent_strategy_edits.py`,
  which parks one writer inside its WDK push while the other commits: a
  parameter edit to `phosphatase` put a committed `INTERSECT` back to `UNION`,
  and a combine-operator edit put a committed `phosphatase` back to `kinase`.
  `apply_operation` now takes the lock before the read and holds it through the
  write, and `persist_strategy_ast_to_conversation` joins that transaction
  instead of opening one of its own. The rejected alternatives, and the agent
  turn this does not cover, are
  [a decision](decisions/a-graph-operation-holds-the-thread-lock-across-its-read.md).

* **A resumed tail reads one turn at a time, so a suspended turn's card is
  drawn once.** `ai@6.0.154` builds one assistant message per stream and
  seeds it with the message the client already holds
  (`AbstractChat.makeRequest` -> `createStreamingUIMessageState`), and its
  `start` case only renames that message. A tail that carried a durable task's
  gap and then the continuation turn therefore ended with the continuation
  holding the suspending turn's parts: measured on the e2e stack's production
  build as one `data-background-task-started` frame on the wire (1 chat POST,
  2 tail GETs, 1 snapshot) and two `Optimize parameters / Completed` rows,
  with `durable-progress-live.spec.ts:137` red on a strict-mode violation.
  `DurableChatTransport` now ends a resumed stream at a `start` that opens
  another message, keeps the frame iterator, and serves the rest to the next
  resume; `resumeDurableThread` opens that message first, so no second request
  is made and each turn is read into its own message. PROTOCOL 1.5.2 states
  the reader rule in section 9. The rejected alternatives are
  [a decision](decisions/a-resumed-stream-reads-one-turn.md).

* **The e2e stack serves the production build, and the suite finishes in one
  process.** `docker-compose.e2e.yml` pins `web.build.target: runner`, which
  overrides the dev overlay's `dev` target and makes the local recipe build the
  image CI already built. The dev server it replaces compiled a route on every
  first request and kept the result: 7.44 GiB of anonymous memory, then
  `OOMKilled=true` part way through a run that ended `54 failed / 1 skipped /
  66 passed`, 47 of them on `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED`. Rebuilt on the dev target
  to compare the two, it did not even survive the global setup's twelve route
  requests - dead in 2 m 48 s, with single compiles of 14.8 s to 23.4 s in its
  log. The production container holds 96 MiB at boot and 182 MiB mid-suite, and
  one `playwright test --retries=0` process now runs all 158 tests. The
  reasoning and the rejected alternative - `mem_limit` plus
  `--max-old-space-size` on the dev server - are
  [a decision](decisions/the-e2e-stack-serves-the-production-build.md).

* **Neither dev overlay reaches the suite any more, and the devtools bubble is
  off the nav rail.** A production build mounts no `<nextjs-portal>`, and
  `@tanstack/react-query-devtools` 5.95.2 resolves its own entry to
  `function () { return null; }` unless `NODE_ENV === "development"`, so the
  seven specs that timed out on a click an overlay swallowed
  (`settings.spec.ts:8,13,22`, `auth.spec.ts:64`, `memory-settings.spec.ts:5`,
  `full-researcher-lifecycle.spec.ts:19`, `workbench-panels.spec.ts:235`) are
  green; the lifecycle journey that burned its whole 720 s budget on the retry
  loop finishes in 47.3 s. For the dev stack, where the toggle does render, its
  `buttonPosition` moves off the left edge the nav rail owns, pinned by a
  vitest. `no-dev-overlays.spec.ts` asserts both overlays are absent and that
  the Settings gear takes the first click.

* **The FRAME budget card closed on its own anchors.** Both halves the card
  tracked are in the tree and pinned: `phase_usage_limits(declared_criteria)`
  scales the ceiling with the declared criteria between a floor and a cap,
  and `frame_result_from_draft` reports the bound criteria when a pass
  exhausts its budget instead of discarding them. The card's own text
  recorded both as closed; the "done when" holds, so the card leaves.

* **No module explains itself by what Kani did.** The two platform
  docstrings that still did (`tool_errors.py`, `pydantic_validation.py`) now
  state what the module owns; the rendered API pages carry no framework
  history.

* **The docs build imports three modules before Sphinx starts, and 40 pages
  gain their API.** `apps/api/docs/conf.py` imports `fastapi.openapi.models`,
  `langchain_core.messages` and `pathfinder.transport.http.schemas.sites` after
  it extends `sys.path`. Autodoc's type-comment pass writes the source text of
  `pydantic.BaseModel.__pydantic_extra__` back into `BaseModel.__annotations__`,
  which `ModelMetaclass.__new__` had cleared; pydantic then evaluates that
  string in the namespace of whatever model is built next, and a model with
  `extra="allow"` in a module without `Dict` raises `NameError: name 'Dict' is
  not defined`. FastAPI declares such a model, so every module that imports
  FastAPI failed. Building those three first removes the 40
  `autodoc: failed to import` warnings, and `docs/api/transport.rst` renders
  925 API objects across its 40 modules instead of prose with nothing under it.
  Sphinx 9.1.0 is the newest release and carries the pass; the reload the card
  blamed is gated on `SPHINX_AUTODOC_RELOAD_MODULES` and never ran. The
  reasoning and the two rejected alternatives are
  [a decision](decisions/extra-allow-models-are-built-before-autodoc-runs.md).

* **`sphinx.ext.napoleon` is on, so the tool reference shows each tool's whole
  contract.** The tool docstrings are Google style and the config had no
  extension that parses Google style, so every `Args:` block rendered as a
  block quote and lost the lines after the first indented continuation:
  `build_strategy`, `lookup_gene_records` and `search_for_searches` each
  published a truncated contract. Napoleon renders them as parameter lists and
  removes 13 of the 17 docutils warnings without touching a docstring, which
  matters because each of those strings is also the tool description the model
  reads. The remaining four, in two docstrings, are fixed as markup: the
  module docstring of `ai/graph/stream_events.py` escapes the plural after an inline literal (and
  becomes a raw string, so Python 3.14 does not warn on `\ `), and the example
  in `build_strategy` opens with `::` so its code is a literal block. No word
  in any docstring changed. `autodoc_inherit_docstrings` is off, so a
  third-party base class's prose is no longer published as this project's API;
  it was pulling `pydantic_settings`' `Args:` block into
  `TomlConfigSettingsSource.__init__` and taking an ambiguous `type`
  cross-reference with it.

* **`overview.rst` and `ai_functions.rst` describe the system that exists.**
  The overview is rewritten around the installed assistants, one chat turn
  (dispatcher, deferred `chat_turn` job, worker, two-node graph, durable event
  log), the Lead with FRAME, BUILD and VERIFY as tools, durable tools, the
  typed `data-*` parts, cross-thread memory and the layer rules; the Kani
  sections, the `subkani_*` event table, the delegation-plan grammar, the
  `@-mentions` block whose service no longer exists and the Redis dropdown are
  gone. `ai_functions.rst` is now the tool index by caller: Lead, FRAME, BUILD,
  VERIFY, EDA, the shared three, and the approval and durable mechanics.
  `conf.py` no longer resolves an intersphinx inventory at `kani.readthedocs.io`,
  and `grep -ri kani apps/api/docs` returns nothing. Two module docstrings
  still name the old framework and are published on `docs/api/platform.rst`;
  they are [a new card].
  With all three cards closed, `uv run sphinx-build -b html docs docs/_build/html` exits 0 with
  **3 warnings**, down from 73; all three are the one ambiguous `kind`
  cross-reference across the 13 classes that declare that attribute. Two
  docstrings that only became visible once their modules imported open a bullet
  list directly under a colon line, which docutils reads as an unexpected
  indentation: the module docstring of `ai/tools/standalone/optimization.py`
  and `dispatch` in `ai/conversation/dispatcher.py` each gained the blank line
  the list needs.

* **An `automodule::` target that names nothing now fails a test, not a page.**
  All 73 dangling targets are gone from `apps/api/docs/api/*.rst`: the ones
  whose module moved are repointed (`transport.http.sse` to `sse_utils`, the
  four `routers.strategies.*` to `routers.conversations.*`, `schemas.chat` to
  `schemas.conversations`, `schemas.strategies` to `schemas.strategy_ast`,
  `persistence.session` to `assistant_core.platform.db`,
  `services.experiment.core.streaming` to `services.experiment.streaming`, the
  four experiment enrichment modules to the `services.enrichment` package,
  `integrations.veupathdb.site_search` to `site_search_client`), and the ones
  whose surface is gone lost their prose with them (`platform.redis` and the
  Redis event-bus dropdown, `platform.events`, the seven
  `services.strategies.engine.*`, `domain.parameters.normalize`,
  `domain.strategy.compile`, the workbench-chat endpoint table). Three pages
  described a framework the product replaced: `agents.rst` is rewritten around
  the Lead and the FRAME, BUILD and VERIFY sub-agents, `chat.rst` around the
  dispatcher, the worker turn runner, the two-node graph and the durable event
  log, `tools.rst` around the phase toolsets and `ai/tools/standalone`;
  `engines.rst` and `delegation.rst` are deleted with their toctree entries and
  the two grid cards that linked them, and `ai.rst` is now the model page
  (catalog, resolution, settings, tiers, scripted model, pricing). The gate is
  `tests/unit/test_sphinx_automodule_targets_import.py`, which walks every
  `.rst` under `apps/api/docs`, extracts each target and imports it: it failed
  on 73 of the 241 targets before the change and passes on all 278 after.
  `sphinx-build` stays without `-W`, and its warning count falls from **108 to
  73**: no warning left says a module is missing. Three cards carry what
  remains, all of it outside the docs tree - 40 live modules autodoc cannot
  reload under Python 3.14 (`NameError: name 'Dict' is not defined`, raised
  re-executing `fastapi.openapi.models`), 17 tool docstrings written as plain
  text where the renderer wants reST, which truncate in the tool reference,
  and the Kani-era prose in `overview.rst` and `ai_functions.rst`, which carry
  no target for the new gate to reach.

* **The backend coverage gate was red on two tests that pass on their own,
  because a devtools library call routed the whole process's logs to stderr.**
  `uv run pytest --cov=src --cov-fail-under=40 -q` reported
  `2 failed, 4542 passed` on `test_memory_deadline.py::test_retrieval_degrades_to_no_memories`
  and `test_worker_heartbeat.py::test_a_wide_gap_is_reported`, both
  `assert '...' in ''` on `capsys.readouterr().out` with the warning text under
  "Captured stderr call"; the unit-only run was green, because the integration
  tier collects first. `devtools/chat.py::drive_run` and `run_respond` called
  `structlog.configure(logger_factory=PrintLoggerFactory(file=sys.stderr))`, so
  every integration test that drives a run left the process logging to the
  stderr object of that test. Routing the framework's logs is the command
  line's job: the call is now `route_framework_logs_to_stderr`, made once in
  `chat.main()` and once in `evals.main()`, and
  `test_run_once_leaves_the_global_logger_config_alone` compares
  `structlog.get_config()` across a driven run. The suite also restores the
  configuration around every test (`tests/conftest.py::_restored_logger_config`),
  and `tests/unit/test_global_logger_config_does_not_leak.py` reconfigures
  structlog in one test and reads the logger on stdout in the next. The second
  half of the same leak was the stdlib side: the app lifespan calls
  `setup_logging`, which appended a root handler bound to the stdout of the test
  that ran it - five root handlers after one run, and a later test's
  `capsys.readouterr().out` came back empty for `logging` output too. The
  lifespan test's `isolated_lifespan` fixture now patches `setup_logging` like
  every other dependency it isolates, and
  `test_the_lifespan_leaves_the_process_s_logging_alone` compares
  `logging.getLogger().handlers` across a lifespan run.

* **A misclassified imperative turned into a refusal with a false excuse, and
  two paid turns produced nothing.** "Yes, rerun the differential expression ...
  and then create the strategy step ..." and "Please run the differential
  expression now ... add the resulting genes ... as a step in my strategy." were
  both classified `follow_up_question`, so `intent_gate.hide_building_tools`
  removed the nine building tools and the Lead answered that "the analysis
  controls ... are not available in this turn. Please retry this request.";
  only a third message, classified `extend_strategy`, built. Two layers changed.
  `classify_user_intent` now states that an imperative to run, rerun, build, add
  or create - a bare "yes, do it" that accepts the assistant's own offer, and a
  retry after a failed task - is a building classification and never a
  `follow_up_question`. The Lead's rules now answer a missing building tool with
  `classify_user_intent` again as the FIRST action, and forbid both the
  unavailable-tool sentence and asking the user to retry. The gate was measured,
  not assumed: `test_a_corrected_classification_unhides_the_building_tools`
  drives a run whose first classification is `follow_up_question` and whose
  second is `extend_strategy`, and the step after the correction carries
  `build_strategy` and `edit_strategy`, because `PrepareTools` runs on every
  model step and reads `LeadDeps` live. The corpus case
  `an-assent-to-build-builds` is the counterpart of `question-turns-do-not-build`:
  an offer context, then the measured assent, and a persisted `GenesByTaxon`
  strategy. 8/8 cases pass under the deterministic provider.

## 2026-08-30

* **Turn-driving feature specs run serialized, and the e2e suite's last
  harness reds are fixed.** `apps/web/playwright.config.ts` splits the feature
  project in two: `feature-turns` carries the nineteen specs that send a
  message through the mock provider and waits on a turn, with
  `fullyParallel: false`, and `feature` ignores the same list, so
  `playwright test` still runs all 156 tests once. `auto-build`,
  `execution-phase` and `ai-workbench-integration` pass in the full run, and
  `fungal-pathogenesis` has its first green run since the fixme came off.
  Four specs reached `/conversation/<id>`, which is a 404 without the site
  segment; `eda-chat-parts` asked for "Open EDA" and "Open in EDA tab", which
  the vocabulary decision renamed to "Open Studies" and "Open study";
  `durable-progress-live` asked for a "Task completed" card the thread
  redesign replaced with a task row; `user-data` accepted a `seed_complete`
  frame that reported zero strategies, and now reads its counters;
  `toxoplasma-host-invasion` asserted a union preview while the compose bar
  still showed Intersect, and `expectComposeResultCount` is scoped to the
  sidebar that owns it; the two journeys that open with "I'm investigating"
  now assert the context-statement reply instead of the mock marker.
  `e2e/global-setup.ts` warms one request per route pattern before the run, so
  a spec no longer pays a route's first compile inside its own budget, which is
  what the Turbopack decision already prescribed: the first analysis spec on a
  restarted container goes from 1.4 min to 9.4 s. `makeWdkLinked` in
  `dismissed-strategies` read the conversation it had just created off the
  first sidebar row, which is a race with the refetch: under load both calls
  returned the same id, the test dismissed the conversation it meant to keep,
  and the end state was the other one still active. It reads the id from the
  route instead, through `openConversationId`.

* **The last module over the 400-line cap was split along its own seam.**
  `domain/parameters/values.py` 428 -> 197 meaningful lines: it owns the eleven
  `*Value` models, the filter clauses one of them carries, and the `ParamValue`
  union, and nothing else. `value_codec.py` (219) owns the translation: the wire
  and decoded payload builders, `from_wire`/`to_wire`, `from_decoded`/
  `to_decoded`, the maps over them, and the coercion of a raw scalar, list or
  dict into a typed value. `close_open_range` went to `canonicalize.py` (160),
  its only production caller and the module that already owns the spec-dependent
  post-processing, so the `ParamSpecLimits` Protocol that existed only to keep
  `values.py` from importing `specs.py` is deleted and the function takes
  `ParamSpecNormalized` directly. No re-export and no shim: 26 modules and 10
  test files import the module that defines the name, and the two rule anchors
  that pointed into the moved half (`WDK-MAP-001` at `_WIRE_BUILDERS`,
  `WDK-VOCAB-004` at `coerce_context_values`) point at `value_codec.py`.
  `check_max_lines.py` exits 0.

* **The workbench chat surface is deleted, not revived.** The eight experiment
  tools split out on 2026-08-30 had no importer outside their own island: no
  toolset named `refine_with_search`, `refine_with_gene_ids`,
  `re_evaluate_controls`, `fetch_result_records`, `lookup_gene_detail`,
  `get_attribute_distribution`, `compare_gene_groups` or `search_results`, and
  no agent was parameterised on `WorkbenchDeps`. Nine files go:
  `ai/tools/standalone/experiment_refinement.py` and `experiment_analysis.py`,
  `services/experiment/strategy_refinement.py`, `result_analysis.py`,
  `workbench_deps.py`, `ai_analysis_helpers.py` (reachable only from the two
  service halves), `ai/prompts/workbench_chat.py`, `ai/prompts/experiment/
  workbench.md`, and `tests/unit/services/experiment/
  test_split_experiment_tools.py`, whose 344 lines tested nothing else. The
  `"workbench"` entry left `_LOCAL_FILES` in `platform/langfuse/prompts.py`, so
  `seed_prompts()` no longer uploads a prompt nothing loads. Eight
  `vulture_whitelist.py` entries go with them, and the Sphinx pages stop
  describing an agent that does not exist: the `WorkbenchAgent` section in
  `docs/api/agents.rst` (it still named Kani and seven tool mixins), the
  `Workbench Chat` section and two schema/router automodules in
  `transport.rst`, the `AI Analysis` and `Strategy Refinement` sections in
  `experiments.rst`, and the prompt automodule in `ai.rst`. `apps/api/
  README.md` no longer lists a `services/workbench_chat/` directory. The audit
  that found those stale pages also found 73 other `automodule::` targets with
  no module behind them, recorded as its own card.

* **An eval case is a thread, and the corpus can now hold an edit.** `EvalCase`
  states `turns`, a list driven in order on one conversation id, and `prompt`
  is gone with no alias; the five shipped cases carry a one-entry list, so none
  of them changed what it asks. The expectation gained `stepIdsUnchanged`,
  observed from the persisted strategy's `wdkStepIds` on both sides of the last
  turn (a thread that held none before it observes `None`, so nothing passes
  vacuously), and `parameters`, which names per search the values that search
  must carry. Two cases were written from the closed edit defects and both were
  measured against live plasmodb through the deterministic model:
  `edit-keeps-the-criteria-it-was-told-to-keep` (build three criteria, then
  "swap the organism on the seed criterion and keep the rest") and
  `edit-does-not-mint-new-wdk-step-ids`. Each was shown to fail on a reverted
  guard and pass on the guard restored, both reverts byte for byte. Removing
  the pre-edit tree the commit diffs against (`commit.py`, `old_ast = None`)
  turned every step into a fresh WDK step: `stepIdsUnchanged: expected 'True',
  got 'False'`. Seeding the edit's FRAME draft with an empty spec instead of
  the spec the strategy already holds (`dispatch_context.py`) left the swap
  unapplied: `parameters.GenesByTaxon.organism: expected 'Plasmodium vivax
  P01', got 'Plasmodium falciparum 3D7'`, with parameter fidelity 0.5. Recorded
  as a measured limit: the shrink path the first case describes is closed by a
  refusal rather than by a value, so the case reads the swapped parameter, not
  the node count, to tell a landed edit from a refused one.

* **Eval scoring answers "how far", not only "same shape or not".**
  `pathfinder.evals.distance` implements the retired thesis decomposition in
  plain Python and adds no dependency: topology as a normalised Zhang-Shasha
  distance with the labels erased, search selection as a Jaccard distance over
  the search names, a labelled distance that charges 0.3 for a differing
  operator and up to 0.7 for parameter divergence, and parameter fidelity over
  the searches the two trees share. The two rows the item filed now separate:
  `((GenesByText UNION GenesByGoTerm) INTERSECT GenesByTaxon)` against the same
  tree with `INTERSECT` in place of `UNION` scores topology 0.0, searches 0.0,
  labelled 0.06; against `GenesByLocation` it scores 0.8, 1.0, 1.0. The
  expected side is parsed from the case's structure signature, so a case still
  states one readable string. Every case result carries the four numbers, on a
  pass as well as a failure. `zss`, `numpy` and `scipy` stay out of the API
  image: Zhang-Shasha is seventy lines, and pairing searches by name in
  postorder is already the optimal name-only alignment the Hungarian solver was
  there for. [The harness decision](decisions/the-eval-harness-is-pydantic-evals.md)
  records it and what it rejects.

* **Eval extraction keeps the first envelope of an id, as the client reducer
  does.** `read_turns` opened a turn at every user-message envelope, so a
  legacy conversation holding one duplicated envelope extracted a phantom turn
  with the request twice and the reply split across two turns. It now skips an
  envelope whose id the thread already carried; an envelope with no id still
  opens a turn, because one id names one message and no id names none. Pinned
  over the incident-shaped sequence: one duplicated envelope between two text
  deltas yields one turn, one request, and the joined reply.

* **The services layer holds no agent framework, and the vocabulary filter
  filters.** `services/experiment/ai_refinement_tools.py` and
  `ai_analysis_tools.py` imported `pydantic_ai.RunContext` inside services.
  They are split the way the four catalog tools were: the WDK halves are
  `services/experiment/strategy_refinement.py` and `result_analysis.py`, which
  take the site and the experiment by value and return typed models, and the
  `RunContext` halves are `ai/tools/standalone/experiment_refinement.py` and
  `experiment_analysis.py`. The import-linter contract that says services never
  import transport or AI now also forbids `pydantic_ai`, so the whole layer is
  covered rather than two entry points, and the contract was proved to bite by
  planting the import and reading the break. In `services/catalog/
  search_inspection.py` the `isinstance(vocab, dict)` branch is gone, because
  `WDKVocabulary` is a list or a `CamelModel` tree and never a dict; the filter
  now walks a tree and keeps the branches that reach a match, so a query on the
  `GenesByMolecularWeight` organism tree narrows 90 leaves to 25 and the
  rendered tree no longer offers `Plasmodium berghei ANKA` under `falciparum`.
  The list branch matched `str(term)`, the pydantic repr, so the query `root=`
  matched all 48 entries; it reads the term and the label now and matches none.

* **A stopped turn closes the tool calls it left open.** The error path
  already wrote `tool-output-error` for every open call; the stop path wrote
  only the stopped event, so a lead tool call interrupted by Stop stayed
  `input-available` and its trace row read as running forever. The cancel
  branch of the turn driver now closes every open call with "Stopped by the
  user.", pinned by a test that stops a turn mid-call and reads the closing
  chunk. The stub writer in that test now satisfies the writer protocol, and
  the last type suppression in the test tier went with it.

* **The small UI defects of the 2026-08-17 run are closed, and the three the
  e2e run measured with them.** Fixed: a refused request now reports what the
  server said, because `extractErrorMessage` reads `detail`, then each
  `errors[].message`, then `title`, so a plan refusal reads "Record type is
  required" rather than "HTTP 422 Unprocessable Content"; `streamTypedEvents`
  throws that same `APIError` instead of `stream failed: 403`; and the chat's
  failure notice runs the transport's rethrown body through `toUserMessage`.
  The status line and the Progress panel read the running phase off the same
  `data-sub-agent-call` chunks the trace reads (`runningPhase`), so neither can
  lag the card any more - `build_strategy` runs no sub-agent and sends no
  status label of its own. A Progress tab with nothing behind it raises no dot
  (`ledgerTabHasContent`). Every message action carries an `aria-label`. The
  rail panel overlays the chat below the width where the chat would be a
  sliver: at 866px with the list and a panel open the chat column is **54px**,
  so `shouldOverlayRailPanel` floats the panel instead. The thread's scroll
  surface is `ThreadPrimitive.Viewport`, whose `scrollToBottomOnRunStart`
  scrolls on send; `use-stick-to-bottom` is gone. Rail markers are keyed by
  conversation, so a fresh thread shows no Tasks dot. A finished task links to
  the turn that carries its result, from the card and from the Tasks panel row.
  The enrichment panel renders the analyses the API saved on the gene set and
  invalidates that query after a run, so a run's 200 reaches the page through
  the cache and a set the researcher returns to still shows its results. The
  Compose panel no longer promises a Venn it cannot draw: a set opened from a
  strategy stores no gene IDs, so `SetVenn` says that instead of captioning an
  empty area. `devIndicators: false` stops the dev overlay taking pointer
  events. `--chart-1`, `--chart-2` and `--chart-3` are darkened so a gene-set
  source badge reads at AA over its own tint - `--chart-3` measured **3.53:1**
  on a card and now measures **4.61:1** at worst, pinned for all four badge
  tokens in both grounds by `statusTokens.test.ts`. Shown not to reproduce: the
  workbench polls nothing (every one of `gene-sets`, `control-sets`,
  `me/quota` and `veupathdb/auth/status` resolves to a 30 s `staleTime` and no
  `refetchInterval`, pinned in `features/workbench/api/polling.test.ts`), and
  the phase card that stayed `started` after Stop is closed by the client's own
  reader rule. Moved, not dropped: inserting a saved strategy from an empty
  Strategy panel and the constraints a later turn forgets belong to the
  saved-strategy and accumulated-requirements work.

* **A vocabulary entry names its parent, and a search that cannot be read no
  longer reads as one that does not exist.** `WDKVocabTerm` is
  `tuple[str, str, str | None]` and exposes the third element as `parent`, which
  is what `EnumParamVocabInstance.getFullVocab` writes; the reference client
  types that column `null` and is wrong about its own platform
  ([WDK-VOCAB-007](wdk/rules/parameters-and-vocabularies.md)). Before the change
  `GenesByOrthologPattern` failed with **1802 validation errors** on plasmodb and
  no route could read its parameters; after it the live document parses and
  `phyletic_tree_of` builds **903 nodes under 3 roots**, with
  `derive_binding(pfal, hsap)` giving `%hsap:N%pfal:Y%`. `PhyleticTree.from_vocab`
  now attaches a term to the parent it names and falls back to the indent stack
  only for a term that names none, and plasmodb and toxodb agree on all 903 rows
  that the indent depth is the parent's depth plus one. The failure that hid this
  is gone too: `_fallback_scan_record_types` answers a search WDK lists but cannot
  serve with `reading <search> failed: <cause>`, keeps `Search not found` for a
  name that is genuinely absent, and drops the search itself from its own
  did-you-mean.

* **The substitution report compares each parameter as what it states.** A filter
  is compared as its clause set - each clause by field, `isRange`,
  `includeUnknown` and its values as a set - so key order, clause order and a
  dropped `fieldDisplayName` no longer read as a value WDK chose. Measured on
  plasmodb: posting `variation_sample_meta` to `GenesByNgsSnps` with every other
  parameter bound returns `isValid: true` and echoes the caller's own string
  verbatim, while `FilterValue.to_wire` re-serializes it with the keys reordered
  and the display name gone, so the old text comparison reported the parameter as
  substituted. An `input-step` is now excluded by name: its value is the wiring
  the caller made, never a choice WDK made, and `canonicalize` says so where it
  skips it ([WDK-PARAM-008](wdk/rules/parameters-and-vocabularies.md),
  [WDK-PARAM-009](wdk/rules/parameters-and-vocabularies.md)).

* **A step carries its own record class, and the strategy's is the root's.**
  `StrategyStep.record_class` holds the record type WDK lists that step's search
  under; `assign_step_record_classes` fills it from the site catalog,
  `validate_parameters` reports the class it resolved, and the push addresses each
  step's search URL from the step's own rather than from one value per graph.
  `record_class_of` reads a step's class and takes a combine's from the steps it
  consumes, `sync_strategy` sets the strategy's class from the root through it,
  and the leaf-first `resolve_record_type_from_steps` is deleted along with the
  unreferenced `services/strategies/search_resolution.py`. The pin is live on
  plasmodb: `GenesByMolecularWeight` is listed under `transcript` and
  `GenesFromTranscripts` ("Transform Transcripts to Genes") under `gene`, and each
  404s under the other - `There is no search "GenesFromTranscripts" associated
  with record type "TranscriptRecordClass"`. **[WDK-STRAT-004](wdk/rules/strategies-and-steps.md)
  is `ENFORCED`, and the bundle's `UNENFORCED` column is now empty**: 84 rules, 80
  enforced, 4 partial. The persisted AST gains no field, so there is no migration:
  the class is derived from the catalog on the push and the sync that use it.

* **The hidden-default sweep stops at published defaults, by ruling.** Measuring
  `channel` (75 searches) and `dataset_url` (56) needs a plausible value per
  search rather than a published one, which is 131 separate studies whose answer
  is a property of the datasets loaded that day. The sweep already names every
  outcome: `SweepReport.measured` carries one row per search with its status and
  WDK's own message, so the 58 that answer 500 are listed by name in the
  `wdk-hidden-defaults.json` the nightly lane uploads, and none of the 158
  refusals names a hidden parameter. Recorded as
  [the sweep stops at published defaults](decisions/hidden-default-sweep-stops-at-published-defaults.md)
  and linked from [WDK-PARAM-010](wdk/rules/parameters-and-vocabularies.md); no
  code changed.

* **The two EDA subset searches count the same genes; the 46 that separated
  them was transcripts against genes.** Measured on plasmodb.org on the same
  day with one analysis spec (`DS_53f554ec6a`, `VAR_035294d0` = "P. berghei"),
  `GenesByPhenotypeEdaSubset_PlasmoDB_Rod_Mal_Phenotype_RSRC` and
  `GenesByEdaSubset` both answered `totalCount` 5602 and `displayTotalCount`
  5556. The earlier 5602-against-5556 was one result read through two counts,
  and `estimatedSize` tracks the display one (WDK-FILTER-005). The model agrees:
  the two process queries are the same plugin with the same four `wsColumn`s,
  differing only in `visible="false"` on the dataset id. One real difference
  did turn up and is now documented with it: `eda_analysis_spec` declares no
  `allowEmpty`, the per-dataset template overrides it to true, and the generic
  search answers HTTP 422 "Cannot be empty." for an unfiltered analysis, where
  the per-dataset search answers 5810/5764. `eda-wdk-bridge.md` carries the
  table and the pinned model links.

* **"N genes analyzed" is the size of the set that went in.** `percentInResult`
  is result genes over background genes - the GO plugin's own `COLUMN_HELP`
  reads "Of the genes in the background with this term, the percent that are
  present in your result" - so inverting it returned a term's genome-wide
  count, and a 46-gene set read "217 genes analyzed". `derive_total_analyzed`
  is deleted; `EnrichmentService` reads the step's own count once per batch and
  every analysis reports it, and `parse_enrichment_from_raw` takes
  `analyzed_gene_count` because no plugin publishes a result-level total. The
  semantics and the measurement are recorded under WDK-ANS-007.

* **A scored comparison persists encoded parameters, and a failed scoring says
  so.** The single-mode branch of `_persist_experiment_strategy` handed typed
  `ParamValue`s to `WDKSearchConfig` and every variant died with seven
  validation errors; it now encodes with `encode_params`, like the tree branch
  four lines above. A variant that still fails carries one line naming the
  first rejected field rather than the validation dump, and every variant
  carries `control_hits`, the given control ids its result contains - read from
  the experiment when it ran, and from the variant's own answer when it did
  not - so "which threshold recovers these three genes" is answerable either
  way. The tool's summary and its docstring tell the Lead to report a failed
  scoring as one, and the card renders "scoring failed: <line>" with the
  membership beneath it.

* **A dispatch card ends in a terminal state (protocol 1.5.1).** Closing a
  phase card is a reader rule, not a chunk: `buildTrace` in
  `packages/assistant-client-ts/src/core/trace.ts` resolves every dispatch its
  turn left `started` to `cancelled` when the parts carry `data-turn-stopped`,
  to `failed` when they carry `data-turn-failed`, and to `superseded` when the
  host says the turn ended and neither is there. Nothing the graph writes after
  a Stop reaches the log - the astream task is cancelled and only
  `turn_stopped_event()` follows - so the producer cannot close the card, and
  the error path left it `started` too. `TraceGroupState` grows `cancelled` and
  `superseded`, `BuildTraceOptions` grows `turnEnded`, `TraceAnchor` passes it
  for every message but the streaming one, and `TraceGroup` reads the two new
  states as "Stopped" and "Not finished". PROTOCOL.md states the rule beside
  the turn's shape in section 6.

* **A stopped turn stops spinning.** The same close reaches the rows: a call
  still running inside a dispatch the turn cancelled or failed reads the new
  `TraceRowStatus` member `stopped`, drawn with a still `CircleDashed` and the
  word its group carries ("Stopped" under a cancelled dispatch, "Not finished"
  under a failed one). `Trace.running` is therefore false, so the run reads its
  step count instead of "Working..." and collapses like any settled run. A
  `superseded` dispatch keeps its running rows and its spinner: the durable
  task really is still running, and the turn that resumes it settles the row.
  Measured before the fix on a stopped dispatch: group "Stopped", summary
  "Working...", glyph `animate-spin`, `aria-expanded` "true".

* **A checkpoint call is bounded by the turn.** `BoundedCheckpointCalls` in
  `assistant_core/conversation/checkpointer.py` wraps `aget_tuple`, `aput`,
  `aput_writes` and `adelete_thread` in `checkpoint_deadline`, an
  `asyncio.timeout` of `checkpoint_timeout_seconds` (default 30) that raises
  `CheckpointTimeoutError` naming the operation and the window;
  `lifespan_checkpointer` yields `BoundedPostgresSaver` and bounds its own
  `setup()`. The checkpointer was the last Postgres path of a turn with no
  bound: the same single `AsyncConnection` shape the memory store had, so a
  checkpoint read or write that never resolved held the turn and its worker
  slot. The turn reports the typed error through the `error` chunk and
  `data-turn-failed` its driver already writes. Pinned against a saver whose
  every call hangs, which now fails in under 1 s.

* **A turn cannot wait on the memory store without end.** Retrieval at Lead
  entry and the auto-write in `finalize_turn` run inside
  `memory_store_deadline`, an `asyncio.timeout` of
  `memory_store_timeout_seconds` (default 30). Retrieval logs the timeout and
  returns no memories; the auto-write logs and re-raises, so the turn writes
  `error`, `data-turn-failed`, `finish` and `done` instead of holding its
  worker slot. The store was the one outbound call of a turn with no bound:
  `AsyncBatchedBaseStore` awaits a future only its batch task resolves, over a
  single `AsyncConnection` with no statement timeout, and the unit test written
  against a store that never answers ran the full 600 s command ceiling before
  the deadline and 1.26 s after it. `lifespan_memory_store` now cancels and
  awaits that batch task before the connection closes, so a closed store leaves
  no `_run()` task pending at `langgraph/store/base/batch.py:330`. The FungiDB
  journey spec no longer carries `test.fixme`. Decision:
  [a-memory-store-call-is-bounded-by-the-turn](decisions/a-memory-store-call-is-bounded-by-the-turn.md).

* **A busy worker is not a dead one.** The worker's heartbeat moved off the
  event loop the jobs run on: `jobs/heartbeat.py::HeartbeatThread` refreshes
  `procrastinate_workers.last_heartbeat` from a thread with its own loop and
  its own connection every `worker_heartbeat_interval_seconds` (5), and warns
  when a beat lands more than three intervals after the last one. `amain`
  builds the `procrastinate.worker.Worker` itself, because the thread needs the
  worker id the worker registers. Measured with one job holding the loop for
  5.00 s: a beat on that loop lands 0 times and the row reads 5.028 s old,
  while the thread beats 10 times and the row reads 0.315 s old.
  `worker_dead_heartbeat_seconds` therefore drops from 300 s to 60 s, so a
  killed worker's thread unlocks in one to two minutes. On the web,
  `notReady == ["worker"]` renders the app behind a non-blocking banner
  instead of the fatal "Some services failed to start" page, and without
  waiting out the startup grace window. Decision:
  [a-dead-worker-fails-its-turn-by-heartbeat](decisions/a-dead-worker-fails-its-turn-by-heartbeat.md).

* **The agent can start from a strategy the user saved.** FRAME has
  `list_saved_strategies`, a service read of the caller's saved threads on the
  current site (name, thread id, WDK id, record type, root count, step count),
  and `set_criterion(saved_strategy=...)` binds a criterion to one instead of to
  a search. The criterion carries the saved strategy's steps, cloned with fresh
  ids by the same `clone_saved_strategy` the panel's "Insert saved here" runs,
  so the FRAME to BUILD conversion splices the subtree with no I/O: a saved
  operand moves to the combine's secondary input, where WDK marks the collapsed
  reference, and MINUS mirrors to RMINUS when it moves. A reference the listing
  does not hold records an open `saved_strategy` slot before the retry that
  names the listing, so `ready_to_build` stays false and `drop_criterion`
  refuses that criterion: the measured failure was a frame that dropped the
  saved input and built `GenesWithSignalPeptide` alone for 603 genes. On the
  web, `POST /conversations/{id}/insert-saved` accepts an empty `targetStepId`
  and makes the saved strategy the thread's root, which is what the empty
  Strategy panel's new "Insert saved strategy" action and the Saved strategies
  page's "Use in new chat" both call. Decision:
  [a-saved-strategy-is-a-criterion-input](decisions/a-saved-strategy-is-a-criterion-input.md).

* **Building is a response to a request.** `IntentClassification` gains
  `context_statement` and `memory_request`, and a `PrepareTools` capability on
  the Lead drops `frame_problem`, `build_strategy`, `edit_strategy`,
  `recover_failed_steps`, `verify_strategy`, `open_eda_analysis`,
  `set_eda_filters`, `run_eda_compute` and `create_eda_step` from the tool list
  on every turn whose classification is not one of the six that ask for a
  change. `remember` is now a Lead tool and stays visible in every intent, and
  a turn whose classification does not build contributes no strategy memory.
  The deterministic provider classifies once per turn, with a remember arc and
  a context-statement arc; the eval corpus gains
  `question-turns-do-not-build`. The classifier's constraint-kind list is
  derived from `ConstraintKind`, so `percentile` reaches it without a hand
  edit, and the tool tells the model to capture a stated share as that kind.
  Decision:
  [building-is-a-response-to-a-request](decisions/building-is-a-response-to-a-request.md).

* **A clarification adds to the request instead of replacing it.**
  `StrategyDomainState` gains `requirements`, the thread's stated constraints
  deduped on kind AND value, and `original_request`, the text of the first turn
  that stated a request of its own. `classify_user_intent` records both. The
  ledger's constraint section merges the whole accumulated list and the pinned
  summary prints one line per stated requirement, and `framing_goal` seeds a
  missing spec's goal with the original request followed by the clarification,
  so a clarification turn frames from both. Decision:
  [a-clarification-adds-to-the-request](decisions/a-clarification-adds-to-the-request.md).

* **An assumed value is recorded, not narrated.** `set_criterion` takes
  `assumed`, one entry per parameter whose value the criterion text does not
  state and that is not the sheet's default, with the value and one sentence of
  reason. The entries land on `Criterion.assumptions` and the ledger's
  constraint section renders each as a non-blocking `assumed` constraint,
  grounded, with the reason as its note, so the Lead names them from the ledger
  and the user can override any of them. Three refusals guard the input: an
  unknown parameter, a parameter this call left null, and a half of a reference
  and comparison pair, which has no defensible assumption. FRAME's instructions
  say when to declare one. Decision:
  [an-assumed-value-is-recorded-not-narrated](decisions/an-assumed-value-is-recorded-not-narrated.md).

* **A stated share is now checked against the percentile that was bound.**
  `ConstraintKind.PERCENTILE` carries a share and a direction ("top 10%"), and
  `ground_constraints` reads the criterion's `*percentile*` parameter from the
  values the spec bound: a minimum of 90 for "top 10%" grounds, a minimum of 80
  grounds SUBSTITUTED with the note "bound 80 means top 20%", which blocks
  because the constraint is user-explicit. `ground_constraints` therefore takes
  `param_values` beside `param_names`. VERIFY's instructions add that a numeric
  parameter is restated ONLY from its `constraint_report` entry, so a reply
  cannot write an interpretation the bound value does not support, and the
  verification prompt is ASCII throughout.

* **A search overview no longer carries a verdict nothing writes.**
  `SearchOverview` kept `decided`, `selection_status`, `rationale`,
  `selection_reason`, `confidence` and `param_hints`, whose only writer was an
  unregistered tool that is already deleted, so every reader ran against the
  default. The six fields are gone with `SearchSelectionStatus`,
  `AgentToolState.decided_search_names()` and `selected_search_names()`.
  `search_for_searches` and `list_searches` no longer drop a result or append
  the "already-decided search(es) hidden" note, the pinned discovered-searches
  instruction no longer prints a `[selected]` / `[rejected]` tag or a
  confidence, and the verification toolset's enum override keeps only the
  `wdk_step_id` constraint it can fill.

* **The last two modules over the 400-line cap were split along their own
  seams.** `frame_spec.py` 407 -> 370 meaningful lines, beside
  `frame_structure.py`, which owns the other half of an operational spec: the
  tree `set_structure` folds the bound criteria into. The module also drops its
  second copy of `CriterionRole` and reads the domain's. `conversation.py`
  413 -> 292, beside `saved_strategy.py`, whose `SavedStrategyRepository` owns
  the reads keyed by the WDK strategy a thread holds: the saved listing, the
  threads that import one, and the prune of threads whose WDK strategy is gone.
  `ConversationService` reaches those through
  `strategy_ops.list_saved_strategy_consumers`, so the delete guard keeps one
  owner for that query. No re-export and no shim: every caller and test imports
  the module that defines the name. `check_max_lines.py` exits 0.

* **The two modules the revision history grew past the 400-line cap were split
  the same way as the eleven before them.** `fork.py` 474 -> 165 meaningful
  lines, beside `fork_ids.py` (the fork's one id space and the chunk rewriting
  that moves a copied chunk into it), `fork_copy.py` (the event rows and the
  checkpoint rows) and `fork_strategy.py` (the anchor's snapshot and the
  strategy the fork pushes from it); `turn_runner.py` 425 -> 370, beside
  `turn_stop.py`, which owns the Stop path: the cancellation poll, the revision
  the thread opens on, and the restore a stopped turn ends with. No re-export
  and no shim, so a caller imports the module that defines the name, and the
  mechanic the earlier batches recorded held again: a monkeypatched global stays
  in the module the test patches, which moved
  `monkeypatch.setattr(fork_module, "materialize_strategy_snapshot", ...)` onto
  `fork_strategy` and the cancel-watcher patch onto `turn_runner.watch_for_cancel`.
  `check_max_lines.py` exits 0.

* **A strategy now has a revision history, and fork, revert and Stop read
  it.** Every write of `conversation_strategies` appends a `strategy_revisions`
  row through `ConversationRepository`, carrying the `strategy_revision`
  fingerprint, the full AST with its per-step WDK ids and counts, the record
  type, the step count, the WDK strategy id, the name and the message the turn
  ended with. A branch resolves the anchor message's snapshot and pushes that
  tree to WDK as a strategy of its own instead of duplicating the thread's
  current one, so a branch at the turn-2 answer opens on three steps rather
  than the four a later turn built; WDK's `sourceStrategySignature` duplication
  went with the code that used it. A thread with a strategy and no history is
  refused with `FORK_REFUSED` (409) rather than copied, and a branch is refused
  while a durable task runs in the copied prefix. Revert restores the snapshot
  in force at its target, or clears the strategy when the target predates every
  snapshot. A stopped turn deletes what it appended and restores the snapshot
  the thread opened with, or clears a first build that never reached WDK, and
  the epilogue's `data-strategy-revision` reports the restored state right
  after `data-turn-stopped`. A branch now keeps one id space: every copied
  chunk's `messageId`, `message.id` and `turn_id` go through the id map its
  `messages` rows are minted from, copied rows carry `task_id = NULL` so a
  parent revert or delete cannot cascade into the branch's log, and the branch
  copies its source's `assistant_id` and `application_id`. Migration
  `2026_08_30_0003`. The stopped build's phase card and the editor's rendering
  of a validation failure are the two halves of that report this change does
  not reach; both are closed by later entries under this date.
  Decision:
  [a-strategy-has-a-revision-history](decisions/a-strategy-has-a-revision-history.md).

* **Revert now truncates the thread the reader sees.** The revert flow
  invalidated `["conversations", <id>, "messages"]`, a key no query uses, so the
  snapshot query (`["conversations", <id>, "snapshot"]`) never refetched and the
  remount replayed the pre-revert list: the deleted turn stayed on screen with
  the edited message appended under it. The flow now invalidates the snapshot
  query and awaits it, so the client holds the re-snapshotted log before the
  edit is sent. The "Edit earlier message" dialog gained an error line: a failed
  revert or branch renders the server's refusal, the dialog stays open and both
  buttons stay clickable, replacing a toast the dialog covered. `toUserMessage`
  reads a problem body's `title` when it carries no `detail`, which is the shape
  `http_exception_handler` sends, so a 404 reads "Target message not found"
  instead of "HTTP 404 Not Found"; the hand-rolled `isProblemDetail` guard and
  the `isRecord` helper it was the last caller of are deleted. Pinned by
  `apps/web/src/features/conversation/RevertFlow.test.tsx`, which drives the
  real thread over a mocked transport.

* **`packages/shared-ts` now has a formatting gate of its own.** `types.ts` was
  prettier-dirty on the trunk and nothing read it: the `prettier-web` hook
  triggers on that package but runs `prettier --check .` inside `apps/web`.
  The package gains `format`/`format:check` scripts, a `prettier-shared-ts`
  pre-commit hook and a CI step in `check-shared-ts`. The two identical
  `.prettierrc.json` copies in `apps/web` and `packages/assistant-client-ts`
  are replaced by one at the repository root, which every package resolves.
  The package's `lint` script named an eslint it does not install and nothing
  ran it; it is gone.

* **The ledger's sub-agent call counts had no writer and are gone.**
  `InvestigationLedger.sub_agent_calls_this_turn` and `sub_agent_calls_total`
  were never assigned by `derive_ledger` or anything else, so every
  `data-ledger-update` carried an empty list and a zero while a sub-agent ran,
  and the Lead's pinned summary read `## Sub-agent calls this turn: 0` over a
  live dispatch. The thread already records each dispatch as a
  `data-sub-agent-call` part, so the counts are deleted rather than given a
  writer: the two fields, the summary line, `SubAgentCallRecord`, the
  `subAgentCallsThisTurn`/`subAgentCallsTotal` members of
  `DataLedgerUpdatePayload`, the panel's `SubAgentCountSection` and the golden
  SSE fixture's keys. Pinned in `test_types.py` and `LedgerPanel.test.tsx`.

* **Batch 1's re-verification closed three gaps the batch had opened.** The
  `dev-login` credential kind reached `Principal` without the spec, so the
  OpenAPI check was red; the spec and the generated types are regenerated. The
  refresh route relinked every dev-login session to the account the shared
  VEuPathDB token names, which split one Playwright worker across two users on
  every page load; a dev-login session now returns from refresh untouched,
  pinned in `test_refresh_relinks_the_internal_session.py`. The Lead's EDA loop
  ended at `create_eda_step`, so a study-backed strategy was reported from the
  compute summary and never verified; the loop now ends with `verify_strategy`,
  pinned in `test_eda_instructions.py`. Two wasted retries per consultation came
  from the Lead placing background at the top level of `consult_user`; the tool
  now says background belongs to a question's `context`, and its schema is
  pinned to `questions` alone. The second pass then reached the frozen thread
  acceptance journey, which still expected the old trace-row labels (`Search
  eda studies`, `Open eda analysis`, `Search catalog`, `Set criterion`,
  `Preview eda subset`); the vocabulary decision wins, and the spec now
  expects `Find studies`, `Open study`, `Find searches`, `Choose a search` and
  `Preview samples`.

* **The CI, lint, size and build gates now report the code rather than
  themselves.** Seven backlog cards left together and one shrank. `yarn
  format:check` was already green on the trunk, so the formatting card left on
  proof rather than on a reformat; what stayed wrong was that the `prettier-web`
  and `prettier-assistant-client` pre-commit hooks ran `yarn format`, which
  writes, while CI ran `yarn format:check`, which reads. Both hooks now check,
  and CLAUDE.md's frontend list is the five package scripts CI runs, so a gate
  spelled one way in three places cannot pass in one and fail in another.

  `yarn lint` died at the 4 GiB default heap after 210 s with 3.93 GB resident
  and "Ineffective mark-compacts near heap limit". The lint program was reading
  8029 TypeScript files under `.stryker-tmp`, against 1002 under `src`: eight
  sandbox copies of the project that a mutation run leaves behind, each with its
  own tsconfig, each becoming another type-aware program. `.stryker-tmp` and
  `reports` join the eslint ignore set, and the same command now exits 0 in
  42 s at 1.96 GB. An ESLint-API test asks the config whether each generated
  tree is ignored, so the next such directory fails a test instead of a runner.

  `ruff check .` was red on an S608 in the tenancy migration, which built its
  copy statement by interpolating a table name and a column list into a string.
  The statement is now a SQLAlchemy `insert().from_select()` over a `sa.table()`
  built from the catalog's own column names, with `add`, `cut` and `old_like` as
  bind parameters and `to_regclass` taking its qualified name as one; the seven
  migration tests that drive the real database in both directions are unchanged
  and green. `pip-audit` reported 24 advisories across 13 packages, all with a
  fix version: the two pinned checkpoint packages moved
  (`langgraph-checkpoint-postgres` 3.0.5 -> 3.1.1, PYSEC-2026-3635), two direct
  dependencies gained a floor, and the remaining transitives are bounded in
  `[tool.uv] constraint-dependencies` with the advisory id on each line. It
  reports no known vulnerabilities. No advisory needed an ignore.

  The two locks disagreed on `langgraph-checkpoint` (4.0.1 against 4.2.0), and
  also on `langgraph-prebuilt` and `langgraph-sdk`, so the package suite proved
  decode behaviour the app never ran. `assistant-core` owns the checkpoint
  serializer, so it now owns the pin: `langgraph-checkpoint==4.2.0` sits in its
  dependencies and `apps/api` inherits it through the editable path dependency
  it already declares. A test reads both `uv.lock` files and fails when any
  shared `langgraph-*` package resolves to two versions.

  The last five modules over the 400-line cap were split the same way, so
  `check_max_lines.py` now exits 0 and `file-size-api` fails only for the change
  that grew a module: `domain/eda.py` 669 -> 129 beside the study tree it walks,
  the per-entry filter checks and the compute config; `eda_analysis.py` 467 ->
  308 beside the filter sheet and the guidance a result carries;
  `sub_agent_stream.py` 449 -> 263 beside the inner events it renders;
  `ledger.py` 424 -> 143 beside its four sections and their full renderers;
  `sub_agent_dispatch.py` 407 -> 353 beside the deps, the call id and the two
  early ends a dispatch shares with the edit dispatch. Ten modules across the
  two batches, and the two mechanics the first batch recorded held for all of
  them: the tool-summary walk follows a helper a tool's module imports, so the
  three EDA tools keep their `with_summary` calls in the module the walk starts
  from, and a monkeypatched global stays in the module the test patches, which
  pins `stream_sub_agent` and `build_strategy_from_spec` to
  `sub_agent_dispatch.py` and every name the EDA tool tests patch to
  `eda_analysis.py`. The frozen acceptance suite reaches `validate_filters` and
  `find_gene_entity` through `pathfinder.domain.eda`, so both stay defined there
  rather than re-exported.

  Six modules over the 400-line cap were split by responsibility, with no
  re-export shim and no behaviour change: `param_dag.py` 649 -> 237 beside a
  binding module and a filter module; `frame_spec.py` 600 -> 314 beside its
  proposals and its sheet; `strategy.py` 532 -> 203 beside the per-step edits
  and the refusals both halves return; `mcp/server.py` 488 -> 148 beside the
  catalog tools and the user-credentialed tools; `operations/apply.py` 458 ->
  230 beside the delete resolutions and the wiring primitives;
  `step_wdk_push.py` 416 -> 296 beside the WDK calls that create or patch one
  step. Two mechanics surfaced and are recorded on the card that remains: the
  tool-summary walk read a tool's own module only and now follows a helper the
  module imports, and a name a consumer reaches through a module rather than
  from its definition needs that module to declare it in `__all__` or
  `mypy --strict` calls it an implicit re-export. Five modules are still over
  the cap, in trees this work does not own, so the card stays and names them.

  `yarn generate:types` dumped the spec from whichever api container happened to
  be running, so a regeneration during an e2e session committed
  `/api/v1/dev/login` into the shared contract. It now builds the app in process
  with the production route set, and the writer refuses a spec that names any
  path the dev router mounts, reading that set off the router rather than a
  literal. Regenerating changed `packages/spec/openapi.json` and no generated
  TypeScript file: 1068 files came back byte-identical.

  The rule that Turbopack buffers SSE is retired on measurement rather than on
  belief. A proxied `text/event-stream` emitting five frames 300 ms apart
  reaches the client through a Next 16.2.0 dev server with its gaps intact under
  both bundlers - 0.271, 0.302, 0.311 and 0.303 s under Turbopack. The dev
  script, the Dockerfile, CLAUDE.md and the batch-7 plan all name plain
  `next dev`, and [the decision](decisions/the-dev-server-runs-turbopack.md)
  records what was rejected. Turbopack's first frame is later by the on-demand
  compile, which is a cold start and is warmed, not timed out.

  Last, the injection scanner. `warm_up_piguard` built a `PIGuardScanner` and
  threw it away, so readiness primed the page cache and the first real request
  still built an onnxruntime session inside the 5 s enqueue wait - and in a test
  process, which never runs readiness, the red landed on whichever test posted
  first. The warm-up now loads the scanner the request path calls, the dead
  loader is gone, and a session-scoped fixture warms it once per test process
  the way readiness does in production. The 1.2 s bound the card flagged beside
  it no longer exists in the tree.

* **The test gates that could not decide anything now decide.** Five backlog
  cards left together. Both frontend ratchets are green on the trunk and run in
  CI beside `check:boundaries`: 84 tests gained an assertion on a value, and
  the weak-assertion baseline dropped from 209 entries to 62 as the fixed ones
  left it. Two more of the reported 86 were the script's own gap -
  `toBeEmptyDOMElement` was missing from its strong list - and the list gained
  it rather than the tests losing a good matcher.

  The checker also learned what a throwing query is. `getBy*` and `getAllBy*`
  raise when nothing matches, so `expect(screen.getByText("3.48"))` pins the
  value before any matcher runs, and calling that test weak asked its author to
  restate a literal the query already carried. Given a string or regex literal
  as the query's first argument the chain now counts as strong; a variable does
  not, and `queryBy*` and `findBy*` do not, because neither raises. That single
  rule cleared 126 of the 188 baseline entries, which is how many of them were
  never weak. The checker now has a checker,
  `scripts/check-weak-assertions.test.mjs`, in the shape the knowledge and WDK
  rule checkers already use, and it runs in CI.

  Every `.first()` and `.nth()`
  in the six older specs is now a locator that names what it means to click:
  the ensemble chip by its gene set's name, the gene set card by the `title`
  its name span carries, the branch button inside the assistant reply that
  carries it, and the task progress row inside the task that started it. Two
  page objects lost the same escape, because the specs that call them depend on
  it.

  Two api tests reported a machine's load as a product defect. The parallel
  fan-out test now counts the trials in flight and asserts five, rather than
  timing them against a 1.2 s bound that measured 1.47 s at load average 69.
  The deadlines that stand for "the turn finished" are named ceilings on a
  deadlock, and `db_cleaner` drains the turn it is about to truncate under, so
  a slow turn can no longer write an event for a conversation the teardown has
  already removed. Both hold at load average 80.

  `parse_sse_body` splits on `\n` alone. `str.splitlines()` also breaks on
  U+2028, which a recorded EDA study description carries, so a
  `tool-output-available` frame parsed in two while the wire frame was intact.

  The opt-in llm tier is gone. It had no test files at all - a conftest of
  fixtures for three models (`ClarificationQuestion`, `ProblemFrame`,
  `ResearchNote`) that no longer exist anywhere - so there was nothing to
  repair. A collect with `addopts` cleared now runs in CI and in the documented
  backend ladder, so the next tier that stops importing is reported by the only
  command that can see it.

* **Verification can now reach a verdict, and cannot state one the build does
  not support.** Three backlog cards left together. A tool that takes a graph
  id now answers to the VEuPathDB strategy id as well
  (`ai/tools/standalone/_validation_helpers.py::get_graph` resolves it through
  the session's `wdk_strategy_id`), so the lookup that returned "not found" on
  strategy 330558093 returns the graph. A study step is verified by its own
  numbers: `check_study_step` reads the volcano cut out of the step's
  `eda_analysis_spec` through `services/eda/export.py::exported_thresholds`
  and reports one `ConstraintCheck` per threshold the caller names, so the
  measured step reports 1,543 records at 2-fold and p 0.05 with `success true`
  instead of "should be treated as unverified".

  A success digest is now held to the ledger. `run_verification` derives the
  ledger and refuses a `success=True` digest that the build does not support -
  a build that failed, skipped or left a step empty, or a turn that built
  nothing on a strategy with no step in VEuPathDB - and rewrites it into a
  failure digest naming the contradiction. Rewriting at the single write point
  was chosen over a `ModelRetry` on the sub-agent
  (`decisions/the-ledger-outranks-the-verification-digest.md`): retries are
  finite, and the flag also decides the memory auto-write and the eval
  extractor's verdict, so the correction belongs where the digest is recorded.

  The verification playbook now picks its checks from what the turn changed.
  `VerificationScope` carries the turn's spec diff into the sub-agent's deps
  and the verification toolset filters `run_gene_set_enrichment` out of an
  edit that touched one criterion, so "add a P. vivax ortholog transform" is
  answered by a count check rather than a two-minute background job. The Lead
  passes `enrichmentRequested` when the user asked for enrichment by name.

* **One account's EDA authorization answered every later account in the same
  api or worker process.** `services/eda/catalog.py::_permissions` kept the
  `/eda/permissions` answer in a per-site cache, and `/eda/permissions` is an
  account-scoped read: it decides which datasets exist for the caller, which
  can be subset and which can export rows. The first credential to ask on a
  site decided what every later one was told, and `resolve_dataset` raised
  `UnknownEdaDatasetError` from the same map, so an account could be refused a
  dataset it owns or offered one it may not read.

  The entry is now addressed by the site and a sha256 of the request's
  VEuPathDB token, and a call carrying no token is refused before the address
  is built. `studies` stays keyed by the site, because the listing is the same
  for every account. Keying by the numeric WDK user id was rejected
  (`decisions/the-eda-permissions-cache-is-keyed-by-the-credential.md`): the
  `/users/current` round trip buys only the dedup of two tokens belonging to
  one account, and it would put a WDK dependency in a read that is otherwise
  pure EDA. `clear_study_caches` keeps its callers and now drops the new map
  too.

* **The turn that answered a durable call ran on the configured tier, not on
  the model the request pinned.** `jobs/runner.py` built
  `ChatRequestBody(conversation_id=...)` and nothing else, so
  `phase_models` and `phase_reasoning` were empty on the completion turn and
  `resolve_lead_model_context` fell through to the phase tier. The half of an
  investigation a researcher reads the compute numbers from was answered by a
  different model, at a different price, with nothing on the transcript saying
  so.

  The picks now travel on the durable task. `run_turn` publishes the validated
  pair on `phase_overrides_ctx`, `create_background_task` writes it to the new
  `background_tasks.phase_overrides` column (migration `2026_08_30_0002`), and
  `jobs/runner.py::_completion_body` rebuilds the completion turn's request
  body from the row. `BackgroundTaskRepository.create` takes a
  `NewBackgroundTask` spec, so the picks are a named field rather than a
  seventh keyword. Persisting them on the conversation was rejected
  (`decisions/a-durable-task-carries-the-turn-s-phase-picks.md`), because it
  would make a per-request override a thread setting.

* **A durable task's completion replayed the Lead node from its first line, so
  one prompt produced two EDA analyses, three compute jobs and no step.**
  `@durable_tool` called LangGraph `interrupt()` from inside the tool, inside
  the agent run, inside the `lead` node, and the worker resumed with
  `Command(resume=...)`. LangGraph re-executes a resumed node from its start:
  the model was called again, a second analysis was opened, `run_eda_compute`
  deferred a second job before its `interrupt()` returned the stored result,
  and `create_eda_step` failed twice on an analysis that carried no
  computation. The turn never wrote `done`.

  A durable tool is now a deferred tool. The decorator creates the
  `background_tasks` row with the pydantic-ai `tool_call_id` it will be
  answered on (new nullable column, migration `2026_08_30_0001`, which also
  flushes the interrupt-era checkpoints), defers the job, records a
  `DurableDeferral` on the deps, emits `data-background-task-started` and
  raises `CallDeferred`. The turn parks a `PendingDurableCall` beside
  `pending_approval` and closes. On completion the worker announces
  `data-task-completed` and opens a new turn with
  `TurnRequest(durable_result=...)`, which resumes the parked run with
  `DeferredToolResults(calls={tool_call_id: ToolReturn(...)})`; the tool's
  `chunks_from_result` runs there and rides the result's metadata, so the
  summary and the figure land beside the tool's output part. A durable call
  inside the verify sub-agent parks the dispatch with that run's
  `messages_json` and the completion turn re-enters it, so the verification
  verdict reaches the reply. `_resume_graph`, `_interrupt_chunks` and the
  `interrupt` import are deleted, and the turn runner reads `custom` chunks
  alone. The observable wire did not move, so PROTOCOL 6.1 stands.

* **One PathFinder session wrote two EDA analyses under WDK user 1216062453 and
  then read them back as WDK user 1202189953, which answered
  `GET /users/1202189953/analyses/PlasmoDB/Vd6RDIz -> HTTP 403`.** The
  `pathfinder-auth` cookie and the `Authorization` cookie are independent: the
  worker created the analyses with the token the tab carried at dispatch, a
  second VEuPathDB sign-in replaced that token, and the next read ran as the
  other account. Nothing compared the two: `require_registered_wdk_identity`
  asked only whether the token was registered, and `refresh_internal_auth`
  returned early on any `pathfinder-auth` cookie that decoded, so it could never
  relink.

  `services/wdk_identity.py::require_session_matches_wdk_identity` resolves the
  request's token through the cached `resolve_veupathdb_user_id` and raises the
  new 401 `WDK_IDENTITY_MISMATCH` when the internal user differs from the
  session's. The route gate runs it after the login check, and
  `resolve_chat_assistant` runs it for an assistant that declares an identity
  gate, so a mismatched turn is refused before a `chat_turn` job is deferred.
  A token that resolves to nobody is an outage, not a second account, and passes.
  The refresh route now resolves the token's account on every call and mints the
  new internal token when it differs. On the web, `wdkAuthRefusal` reads both
  codes and `handleWdkAuthRefusal` calls the refresh once for a burst and retries
  before it offers the sign-in prompt. The EDA 403 hint is path-aware: a path
  under `/users/` names ownership, not the study-id trap.

* **A model-written `eda_analysis_spec` reached WDK, and every report on that
  step answered `JSONObject["studyId"] not found`.** One conversation held a
  step on `GenesByRNASeq...Febrile_temps_RNASeq_ebi_rnaSeq_RSRCDESeq` whose
  spec parameter read `{"data_type":"read counts","comparison":{...},
  "fold_change":{...},"adjusted_p_value":{...}}` - a document the model
  invented, not an EDA analysis. WDK stores that parameter as a string and
  validates nothing, so the step was created and every `reports/standard` on it
  answered HTTP 400; verification could not read the gene set, and the
  researcher was told the result remains unverified. Prose in the Lead
  instructions was the only defence, and `EdaStepRequest` guarded the
  `create_eda_step` path alone, so `set_criterion` and the four other callers of
  `validate_parameters` accepted any string.

  `validate_parameters` is the one seam every build path crosses, so the check
  lives there. `EdaStepRequest` moved from `services/eda/authoring.py` to
  `services/catalog/eda_backed.py`, beside the two parameter names and the
  guidance it is judged against, and `check_eda_parameters` refuses a value that
  does not parse as an `EdaNewAnalysis` naming the same dataset. An empty spec
  stays valid for a search that is not compute-backed and is refused for one
  that is, because that plugin exports what a computation ranks. The refusal
  carries `eda_backed_guidance` as its detail, so the FRAME retry names
  `open_eda_analysis`, `set_eda_filters`, `run_eda_compute` and
  `create_eda_step` instead of repeating the rejection, and the declarative
  build fails the node before `push_step_to_wdk` is reached.

* **No internal name reaches the researcher.** The first real session showed
  `Open in EDA tab`, `Search eda studies`, a group labelled `Frame`, rail tabs
  `Ledger` and `EDA`, a badge `WDK` and summaries carrying `DS_e973eadd57`.
  `docs/knowledge/decisions/user-facing-vocabulary.md` fixes the glossary
  (study, Studies, Open study; VEuPathDB; Planning, Building, Checking,
  Repairing; Assistant; Progress) and two source scans enforce it: a vitest
  over every JSX text and string literal the app renders, and a pytest over
  every summary line, error title and detail, and refusal message in the
  study tools and services. All 81 registered tools carry a verb in
  `toolNames.ts`, so the Title-case fallback can no longer print a tool's
  internal name; the Lead's instructions carry the same rule for its prose
  and its consult questions. The recorded turn, the rail, the settings page
  and a live turn's prose scan clean.

* **The EDA tab's compute never landed on the analysis, and the consult recap
  could not read the answer it was given.** Running the differential
  expression from the tab answered `PATCH .../eda -> 200` four times and then
  `POST /api/v1/eda/viz -> 409: Analysis HBQKQbX carries no compute`: the
  route submitted the job and never wrote the computation into the analysis
  document, which is the SSOT the volcano reader checks, while the chat path
  already did through `apply_computation`. `run_analysis_compute` now reads
  the document once, applies the computation only when it is missing or
  different (which is also where a study-rejected config is refused before
  any job starts), and submits; a poll tick writes nothing. Route tests pin
  compute-then-volcano and the single write. The recap showed `-` for an
  answered question because pydantic-ai dumps a tool return without aliases:
  the answer reached the log as `question_id`/`chosen_labels` while the
  protocol names `questionId`/`chosenLabels`. `UserQuestionAnswer` now
  serializes by alias; an adapter test pins the wire names, and the recap's
  arrow and placeholder are ASCII. Threads answered before this stay
  snake_case in the log and still show the placeholder; no dual-casing reader
  was added, because a tolerant reader would hide the next mismatch.

* **A real turn drew six one-row traces instead of one, and the cause was an
  empty reasoning part before every tool call.** The first prompt run against
  the redesigned thread on the real provider (the heat shock RNA-seq study,
  febrile versus normal) showed `1 step` six times in a column. The durable
  log for that turn holds eight `reasoning-start`/`reasoning-end` pairs with
  zero `reasoning-delta` between them, one before each call: the model's
  reasoning item carries an empty summary, the adapter emits the part anyway,
  and `buildTrace` rule 1 closed the run on every `reasoning` part. Two fixes,
  each pinned. The grouping rule now says only a `text` part with content
  closes a run; `reasoning`, empty `text` and `step-start` close nothing (the
  overview, the batch-1 card, the conformance suite and the frozen client
  module all say so, and the same three-part shape from the log is the frozen
  case). And the runtime stops writing such parts at all: PROTOCOL 1.4.1
  section 6 states that a text or reasoning part that would stay empty is
  never written, implemented as `EmptyPartGate` in the chat event writer,
  which holds a start until its first delta and drops the pair when the end
  comes first. The thread also renders nothing for a settled reasoning part
  with no text, so the eight empty disclosures that stood above the rows are
  gone with the rows' splitting. The recorded acceptance turn never had an
  empty part, which is why fifty frozen tests and two live journeys passed
  over a shape the real model produces on every step.

  The same turn showed two more things the recorded turn had hidden. The
  trace read `Working...` while the assistant was in fact waiting on the
  user's answer to a consult question: the summary now derives from the rows,
  `Working...` only while a call runs, `Waiting for you` while none runs and
  one waits on an approval or an answer, `N steps` once settled; the frozen
  calm-default module and the frozen e2e journey pin the new word. And the
  first thing a reader saw was `Title set: ...` drawn as a figure with a rule
  and 24 px margins, for a title the sidebar already shows; the
  `data-conversation-title` part now draws nothing in the thread.

* **The e2e lane's blanket 401, a cross-tier settings leak, two tools that
  could not be addressed by strategy id, and a gate that stopped at the spec
  files.** A Playwright worker signs in through the dev-login route as
  `worker-N` and carries the one shared registered VEuPathDB test token, so
  `require_session_matches_wdk_identity` answered 401 `WDK_IDENTITY_MISMATCH`
  on every WDK-backed route. The identity match belongs to a session minted
  from a VEuPathDB identity; a dev-login session is a synthetic user with no
  such account. The dev-login route marks its JWT, `decode_session_token`
  reads the mark, and the `Principal` carries `credential="dev-login"` beside
  `veupathdb-bearer`, which the match returns early for. The login refusal is
  unchanged, so a dev-login session still needs a registered non-guest token.
  Production cannot mint the credential and a test says so twice: the app
  built without the mock overlay carries no dev-login route, and the dev
  router is the only caller of `create_dev_login_token`.

  `test_catalog_index.py`'s sync assertion answered `0 == 3` whenever the unit
  tier was collected in the same process, because `tests/unit/conftest.py`
  wrote `EMBEDDING_INDEX_SYNC_ENABLED=false` into `os.environ` at import and
  never restored it. The unit tier has no database and refuses network calls,
  so the write guarded nothing the tier did not already guard; it is deleted,
  the whole unit tier is green without it, the catalog test now pins the
  setting it asserts on the way its disabled twin already did, and an AST
  scan fails any tier conftest that writes the process environment again.

  `rename_strategy` and `clear_strategy` called `session.get_graph` directly,
  so they alone refused the VEuPathDB strategy id every other tool accepts;
  both now go through `_validation_helpers.get_graph` and say which ids they
  take when the lookup misses. And `check-no-first-nth` read only `*.spec.ts`,
  so a page object hid the escapes from every spec that called it: it now
  reads `e2e/pages/**` too, skips a call named in a comment, and reports zero
  after the four page objects were rewritten to name what they address.

* **The Lead can throw a strategy away, and only the Lead can.** `build_strategy`
  refuses a thread that already has a strategy and `edit_strategy` only changes
  one, so "scrap this and start again" had no tool behind it: `clear_strategy`
  was registered in the execution toolset alone, which the Lead reaches only
  through `recover_failed_steps`. It is now a Lead tool - a thin
  `clear_strategy(ctx: RunContext[LeadDeps], *, confirm: bool)` that builds
  `AgentDeps` through `agent_deps_for` and delegates to the standalone tool -
  registered `requires_approval=True`, so the user answers a card before a step
  is removed. Its card reads "Clear the strategy? This removes every step from
  this thread and from VEuPathDB." through a new `approvalPromptFor` seam in
  `lib/utils/toolNames.ts`; `ApprovalCard` now renders the whole sentence its
  caller wrote instead of appending one, and every other tool keeps the
  standing "X needs your approval before it runs." The build refusal and the
  Lead's instructions name the tool again. The execution toolset's registration
  is gone with it: a repair sub-agent has no business deleting the strategy it
  was sent to repair, and two registrations would be two approval surfaces for
  one act.

* **`get_live_strategy_state` asks the site for every count.** After a hand edit
  in the graph editor the tool answered from `sync_state.step_counts`, which the
  editor never writes: the root read 15 for a strategy the editor showed
  returning 7, the edited step read null, and the step's name still said "top
  20%" while its parameter said 90. `read_live_state` is now async, takes a
  `StrategyReader`, and sources every count from `read_wdk_step_counts` - a
  count the site does not answer for is reported as unknown, never as the count
  from the last build. Step parameters are serialized through `wire_map`, so the
  Lead reads `min_expression_percentile: "90"` rather than a nested value model,
  and the tool's description says the parameters outrank the step's name. The
  summary says "count not available" with `status="warn"` instead of "0 genes".
  Measured on the card's state: root 7, the edited step 752, the text step 2122.

* **One row-to-session parse, pinned by a test.** The assistant spec and the
  worker runtime each used to hold the same guard-parse-fallback over
  `conversation_strategies.strategy_ast`; both now call
  `services/strategies/session_factory.py::persisted_graph`, which raises
  `StrategyAstCorruptError` (`STRATEGY_AST_CORRUPT`) rather than swallowing a
  parse failure into an empty graph. Nothing asserted the two agreed, so
  `test_row_to_session_is_parsed_once.py` now serves one row to both callers and
  checks the graphs, the step counts and the WDK step ids match, that a corrupt
  row stops each of them by name, and that both modules read the one function.

* **The thread's trim now mirrors both tails pydantic-ai refuses.**
  `settled_history` popped trailing messages until the last one was a
  `ModelResponse` with no tool calls, which kept a response the provider paused
  (`state == "suspended"`) as the thread's tail; `UserPromptNode` raises
  `UserError` on a new prompt over that tail as surely as it does over an
  unprocessed tool call. The trim now treats a suspended response as unsettled
  and drops it with its request. A response in state `incomplete` still
  settles, because the library accepts it.

* **A warm-up death now reaches `/health/ready`.** `_warm_up_subsystems` runs
  as a spawned task and each step catches its own expected exception tuples, so
  a type outside those tuples killed the task and left the remaining subsystems
  reporting "loading" forever, traced only by asyncio's
  exception-never-retrieved log at garbage collection. The spawn now carries a
  done callback that logs the exception and calls
  `ReadinessState.fail_loading`, which fails every subsystem and catalog that
  is neither ready nor already failed, with `<TypeName>: <message>` as the
  error. A step that already reported its own error keeps it.

* **The devtools summary counts every tool call its own log holds.**
  `RunCapture` built its call list from `data-sub-agent-step` chunks alone, so
  a turn that ran one agent printed `toolcalls=0` over an `events.jsonl` full of
  `tool-input-available`, and a Lead turn counted its sub-agents' inner calls
  but never its own dispatches. The count is now the union, deduped by
  `toolCallId`: every id a `tool-input-available` announces, plus every
  captured sub-agent step that reached a terminal state. A recorded site_help
  mock run (one `list_veupathdb_sites` call, `toolcalls=0` in its own
  `summary.json`) is pinned as a fixture under the devtools unit tests.

* **A sweep's variants now advance in lanes of their own (protocol 1.5.0).**
  Every variant of a parameter sweep emitted `data-task-progress` under the
  same `id` (the task id), so section 5.2's reconciliation left one part for
  the whole fan-out and the bar jumped between variants and moved backwards.
  `task_progress_event` takes a `lane` and emits `id=<task id>:<lane>`; a
  scoped emitter derives its lane from its scope's values and keeps a
  coalescing budget and an unwritten update of its own, so three variants of
  three updates leave six rows under three ids instead of four rows under one.
  PROTOCOL 6.1 states the lane rule, says the lane is read from `toolSpecific`
  and never parsed out of the `id`, and the client's conformance suite pins two
  lanes reducing to two parts. The thread card renders one row per lane,
  ordered by lane, and a task that runs one sequence is unchanged: bare task
  id, one row.

* **PROTOCOL 6.2 now states the resume sequence the runtime emits.** A resumed
  approval turn re-enters the parked `toolCallId` with `tool-input-available`
  and then `tool-output-available`, and never a second `tool-input-start`:
  pydantic-ai's resume emits its own input-available, which marks the id
  started, so the adapter's missing-start backfill never fires. The document
  described a start-first sequence, so a consumer written from the page alone
  built a reader the reference producer contradicts. Section 6.2 now says the
  resumed turn carries the input chunk alone and that a client MUST open a call
  on `tool-input-available` whether or not a start came before it. The producer
  is unchanged; the client's conformance suite gains the resume half of the
  approval arc.

* **The dead-code checker is pinned, wired, and has no whitelist.** `vulture`
  was configured in `apps/api/pyproject.toml` but declared in no dependency
  group, so `uv run vulture` resolved to a global `vulture 2.14` on a
  pre-3.14 interpreter and reported 69 valid PEP 758 / PEP 695 / `match` files
  as `invalid syntax`. It is now `vulture>=2.16` in the api dev group, where the
  same command reads every file and exits 0. Two gates run it, spelled
  identically: the `vulture-api` pre-commit hook and the `Check for dead code`
  step of the `Lint API` job. `vulture_whitelist.py` is deleted: all 49 entries
  named functions, `min_confidence` is 80, vulture scores an unused function at
  60, and the run without the file returns the same findings as the run with it
  - 16 of the 49 names had no `def` left in the tree. Its live replacement is
  `ignore_names = ["CursorResult"]`, for six imports whose only use is inside
  `cast("CursorResult[object]", ...)`, which ruff `TC006` requires to be a
  string and vulture does not resolve. The one true finding is fixed:
  `Settings.model_post_init` took `__context`, an unused parameter under the
  old positional-only spelling, now `_context: object, /` to match
  `BaseModel.model_post_init`. `min_confidence` 60 was measured and rejected at
  997 findings.

## 2026-08-29

* **Thread redesign batch 3 is closed, and with it the plan: every color is
  a token and every token has both grounds.** `globals.css` now holds one
  light palette on `:root` (neutrals moved onto a single 210 to 215 hue
  family, the status trio untouched, a new chart series that clears 3:1 on
  white) and one dark palette under `:root[data-theme="dark"]`, the `dark`
  variant bound to that attribute so no operating-system setting can fire it,
  the `.dark` class gone, and every shadow, chart, step-kind and scrim token
  defined twice. `chartTheme` reads the ground it is on, `applySiteTheme`
  computes a legible brand primary and its own foreground for either ground,
  the WCAG math exists once in `lib/color/contrast.ts` with a dark gate beside
  the light one, and 110 palette-shade utilities across seven consumer
  clusters became token classes or runtime token reads with value-asserting
  tests. Dark `--destructive` moved from the plan's 65 to 73 percent lightness
  because its own tint measured 3.80:1; the plan's dark kind soft and ring
  literals became `hsl(var(--kind-X) / a)` references because the frozen theme
  module reads `rgb()` as a color and `hsl()` as not. The verifier's first
  pass failed on an undeleted backlog card, a `dark:bg-destructive/60` twin
  that measured 3.55:1 under the new dark foreground, and a validation
  definition an external palette script disputes; the card now states which
  criteria "validated" means. Sixteen dead keyframes, utilities and classes
  left the stylesheet with a referrer proof for each survivor. Both frozen
  journeys pass on the e2e stack; the chart-token backlog item and the
  initiative card are deleted.

* **Thread redesign batch 2 is closed: the thread reads as prose with a quiet
  trace under it.** A turn now renders through `TraceAnchor`, which runs
  `buildTrace` over the whole message and draws the trace once, at the run's
  first row-bearing part: one line per tool call (glyph, verb, the tool's own
  summary), sub-agent phases as labelled groups with their usage, the trace
  open while the turn runs and folded to `7 steps` once it settles. Durable
  jobs are task rows, the approval card is the one bordered box left, the
  fourteen science parts are flat figures with numeric captions (`6 of 12
  Sample, 34,320 of 68,640 pfal3D7 htseq counts`, `1,543 of 5,511 genes
  retained`), and raw JSON exists only under `showRawToolCalls`. Deleted:
  `SubAgentCallCard`, `ToolThink`, `DataTaskProgress`, `DataTaskCompleted`,
  `subAgentStep.ts`, and `Tool`/`ToolHeader`/`ToolContent` from the vendored
  primitives. The verifier's first pass failed on four things: an alpha-faded
  muted class the batch doc itself prescribed and the repo's status-token
  gate forbids; `turn-trace-summary` outside `turn-trace`, which the frozen
  e2e journey scopes inside it; the EDA study title outside
  `data-eda-analysis-state`, which the frozen EDA journey asserts inside; and
  weak assertions in four changed test files. Each became a lead ruling on the
  batch card and a fix; the second pass was green on every gate, both frozen
  Playwright journeys on the e2e stack, and five killed mutation probes, with
  one em dash left for the lead to strip. Batch 3 (tokens) is next.

* **Thread redesign batch 1 is closed: every tool call now says what it did.**
  The wire carries one additive data part, `data-tool-summary` (PROTOCOL
  1.4.0, sections 5.2, 6.3, 9, 12.2), and both conforming reducers fold it
  onto the tool part it names and append nothing. The client gained
  `buildTrace`, the one place the trace grouping rule lives, and
  `mergeSubAgentSteps` moved into it from the app. On the runtime side the
  helper is `assistant_core.graph.tool_summary` (`with_summary`,
  `truncate_summary`, `count_noun`): it lives in the runtime because the
  pilot's boundary test forbids `site_help` from importing `pathfinder.ai`,
  and because nothing in it names a gene. Eighty-three registered tools plus
  `site_help`'s two return through it; the four durable tools emit their line
  at resume; an inner sub-agent call's line becomes the step row's text and
  never reaches the main stream; one call id carries one phase name and one
  sub-agent role. The verifier's first pass failed on three things the
  implementers' own suites could not see: two `empty` statuses (`0 of 4,279
  Gene Phenotype Data`, `0 steps, 0 genes`) that no test drove, and a golden
  SSE gate that did not admit the kind. Fixed with value-asserting tests that
  now kill those probes. Sixty-two redundant `truncate_summary` wrappers came
  off the call sites because the helper normalises once; the five Lead
  dispatch tools emit no summary because their native chunks never reach the
  wire and the sub-agent card already carries the line. A live worker turn
  after the rebuild shows the summaries on the log with every id resolvable.
  Process ruling from this batch: implementers run only their own tests; every
  full ladder, integration run, rebuild and live proof belongs to the verifier.

* **Thread redesign batch 0 is frozen: the tests exist before the code.**
  `docs/knowledge/thread/plan/` records the decision to replace the thread's
  stacked cards and raw tool JSON with a calm science-first default: one
  column of prose, tool activity as a quiet trace of one-line summaries, typed
  science parts as flat figures, durable jobs as task rows, an approval card
  only when the user must act, and the two existing settings flags as the
  whole dev mode. The plan was drafted, then verified line by line against the
  code (about forty citation corrections) and eight lead rulings settled the
  wire (`data-tool-summary` rides its own data chunk because the AI SDK's live
  reducer rejects extra keys on tool chunks; a summary may precede or follow
  its call's output; inner sub-agent summaries are lifted onto the step; one
  entity-count caption format; ASCII usage separator; one phase-label set;
  notices and task rows are never figures). The frozen layer: a recorded
  42-chunk turn built from real EDA fixtures, 22 frontend tests for the calm
  default, the dev mode and the figures, 20 client conformance cases for the
  summary reduction and `buildTrace` (one non-empty run, seven rows, three
  figures, `Working...` while a call awaits approval), an e2e journey gated on
  `THREAD_ACCEPTANCE=1`, and a theme completeness test that skips until the
  dark block exists. All fifty skip cleanly today; the EDA suites are the
  regression net and stay at 41.

* **Embeddings became an API call and two Postgres tables.** The local
  `nomic-embed-text-v1.5` is deleted: 547 MB on disk, 967 MB resident per
  process before it encoded a text, one sequence at a time on CPU in the api,
  the worker and `wdk-mcp`. Measured before the change on 2026-08-29: a cold
  rebuild of every cache was about 110 minutes, the portal alone about 50;
  thirteen of the fourteen committed `.npz` files carried the retired shape, so
  7,184 of 7,699 shipped rows were dead; the quadlets persisted no cache volume;
  and `search_example_plans` re-embedded the whole public strategy list on every
  call, 46 s for a patient client. Every vector now comes from OpenAI
  `text-embedding-3-large` at 1024 dimensions through
  `assistant_core/embeddings/openai_embedder.py`, cut at 2000 characters,
  grouped into requests of at most 256 inputs and 200,000 characters, and run
  eight at a time in input order.
  `assistant_core/embeddings/record_manager.py` owns `embedding_vectors` and
  `embedding_index_entries`: a vector is addressed by
  `sha256(model + "\n" + text)`, two indexes sharing one text share one row,
  `sync_index` embeds only what changed and answers with a `SyncReport`, and
  `search_index` ranks in SQL with `1 - (embedding <=> :query)`. The three index
  ids are `catalog:{site_id}`, `eda-studies` and `public-strategies:{site_id}`.
  Two of the three old indexes multiplied unnormalized vectors, so their scores
  ran to about 340 and the catalog multiplied that by `_SEMANTIC_BOOST = 15.0`:
  the ranking was embedding order and the lexical score did not participate.
  Measured on the plasmodb snapshot over its 515 searches, the top lexical
  score of five research queries was 45.3, 106.9, 44.7, 49.2 and 60.4, so the
  boost is 70.0 against a cosine and a cosine of 0.7 buys 49.0, the median top.
  `EMBEDDING_INDEX_SYNC_ENABLED` replaces `EDA_STUDY_INDEX_BUILD_ENABLED` and is
  true only on the api; the worker and `wdk-mcp` search what the api wrote, in
  compose and in both quadlets, which one test now reads for every guarded unit. An
  `EmbeddingUnavailableError` never 500s: the catalog ranks lexically, the study
  search matches names and says so, the public strategies fall back to token
  overlap, and memory retrieval returns nothing. The nomic query and document
  prefixes are gone with the model, and with them the LangGraph
  `aembed_documents` trap. Recorded as [embeddings are an API call and a
  Postgres record manager](decisions/embeddings-are-an-api-and-a-record-manager.md).

* **A study description is bounded, and a dead worker no longer holds a turn
  open.** One prompt on plasmodb called `search_eda_studies`, the worker built
  the EDA study index cold, and docker reported `oom` and `die 137` on
  `pathfinder-worker-1` 49 seconds later. Measured in the api container with a
  real login: 759 studies, `study_enriched_text` up to 24,820 characters, a
  cold encode of 458.7 s peaking at 4.70 GiB. `study_index.DESCRIPTION_LIMIT`
  now cuts the description at 2,000 characters, which touches 34 of the 759
  and brings the same encode to 368.4 s peaking at 1.19 GiB. Batching the
  model was measured and rejected: a length-sorted batch under a 16,384
  padded-character budget was OOM-killed inside the worker after 47 seconds,
  so `_embed` keeps `batch_size=1` and one document is the only thing in the
  arena. The EDA service answers with the portal's catalog, byte-identical on
  plasmodb, toxodb, hostdb, vectorbase and orthomcl, so the rows live in one
  content-addressed store, `eda-studies.npz`, and `preload_study_indexes` in
  the api warm-up fills it under the service account token, leaving the worker
  nothing to encode. The worker is also forbidden to encode it:
  `EDA_STUDY_INDEX_BUILD_ENABLED=false` sits beside `CATALOG_REFRESH_ENABLED`
  on that container, and a store that does not cover every study raises
  `EdaStudyIndexNotReadyError`, which `search_eda_studies` returns as guidance
  rather than starting a second encode beside the api's; concurrent encodes
  measured 1.170 s per text against 0.485 s alone. On the release side,
  `release_stalled_jobs` now also asks
  procrastinate for the jobs of a worker whose `last_heartbeat` is older than
  the new `worker_dead_heartbeat_seconds` (300 s, ge 60), so a killed worker
  loses its lock five to six minutes after it dies instead of at the hour-wide
  started-age timeout, and Stop calls the same release directly. The window is
  300 s and not 60 s because a live worker was measured 153 s behind its own
  heartbeat during a long frame, so the heartbeat starvation is the
  prerequisite for lowering it; the 30 s window in `platform/health.py` is a
  different question and keeps its number. A released
  turn, and a turn whose own driver raises, now write one `tool-output-error`
  per tool call they left open before the terminator; `PROTOCOL.md` 1.3.1
  states the rule and the client's conformance capture carries it.

* **EDA reached both surfaces, and the seven-batch plan is closed.** A
  researcher can open an EDA study from the thread and from a workbench-style
  tab, and the two edit one analysis: `services/eda/authoring.py` is the only
  writer, every mutation answers with the same `EdaAnalysisState`, and
  `data-eda.analysis-state`, `data-eda.subset-preview` and `data-eda.viz`
  carry it to chat while `GET|PATCH /api/v1/conversations/{id}/eda` carries
  it to the tab. Batch 7 grew the three chat renderers into real cards (the
  volcano and scatter on a canvas beside their readouts, chips from the
  backend's `filterSummaries`, every count against its unfiltered total, an
  "Open in EDA tab" affordance), added the right-rail EDA panel that marks
  unseen EDA activity, and proved the loop with three Playwright journeys
  (chat-only render, tab edit returning on the next state part, export to a
  step the strategy rail lists) plus a conformance spec that parses every
  e2e fixture through the generated schemas, the last of which caught a
  fixture point that omitted its nullable p-values on both the feature spec
  and the frozen journey. The verifier failed the first pass on a chip keyed
  by its text, an untested rail marker and an untested scatter guard; all
  three were pinned and re-probed. The frozen acceptance layer closed
  56 backend, 41 frontend and 3 journey tests without a single line changed
  by an implementer; the lead's edits to it were four constructor
  completions and the journey fixtures' wire shapes. Three repo-wide gates
  stay red on files outside the plan and are backlogged: weak assertions
  (99), Playwright index locators (16), and the dev server's Turbopack flag.
  The concept and architecture-fit documents now read as built, every batch
  document is accepted, and `execute-eda-integration-plan.md` left the
  backlog.

* **A strategy with no spec now describes itself, and a "preserved" claim is
  computed.** Batches E1 to E3 of
  [the edit_strategy fix plan](../design/2026-08-27-edit-strategy-fix-plan.md)
  landed. `domain/strategy/spec_hydration.py::spec_from_ast` reconstructs an
  `OperationalSpec` from the persisted `StrategyAst` - one criterion per
  non-combine node, keyed on the step id, holding the node's bound parameters
  verbatim - and the pre-turn hook runs it whenever the checkpoint holds no
  spec and the session holds a strategy. Measured on the thread the plan
  names: its checkpoint carried `operational_spec = None` on entry and its row
  carried 15 nodes with 15 WDK step ids, so the run that asked the user to
  re-type their filters was mechanism (a), and E1 is the batch that closes it.
  FRAME can no longer report `spec_ready` over a draft with no bound criterion,
  and its workspace prints every bound value in wire form instead of a
  60-character label. `domain/strategy/spec_diff.py::diff_specs` compares the
  spec a turn started from against the one it produced; an undeclared drop and
  a "kept" criterion whose values moved are both a `ModelRetry`, and the ledger
  renders `kept N, changed N, added N, dropped N` from the same comparison.
  Recorded as [preserved is computed, never
  written](decisions/preserved-is-computed-never-written.md). The `E6`
  checkpoint flush is owed: `StrategyDomainState` gained `spec_before_turn`.

## 2026-08-28

* **The EDA tab is no longer a dead end, and one route builder owns the canvas
  path.** A binding read that answers 422 over an out-of-vocabulary stored
  filter now offers "Open a different study" beside Retry; it sends
  `{action: "unbind"}`, clears the cached binding and the store, and shows the
  picker, with the server's detail quoted verbatim. `lib/routes.ts` gained
  `strategyStepUrl` beside `strategyCanvasUrl`, and the six hand-built paths
  call them - one of the six carried no site id, so it pointed at a route that
  does not exist. The entity tree now skips a variable whose `hideFrom` names
  `everywhere` or `variableTree`, while a filter already in force on such a
  variable keeps its chip and can still be removed. The same sweep then closed
  the chat path: eleven thread literals now call `chatUrl`, eight root literals
  call `chatRoot`, four site-less entry points redirect through the new
  `PORTAL_SITE_ID`, and a grep for a hand-built conversation path outside
  `lib/routes.ts` returns nothing.

* **A completed EDA compute puts a volcano on the thread, and the study
  detail carries the site's display advice.** `run_eda_compute_impl` reads
  `volcano_view` at the default cut and emits `data-eda.viz` through the same
  writer, right after the analysis-state chunk that names the revision the
  plot belongs to, so `eda_viz_chunk` has a production caller and the chat
  card draws a real plot. `volcano_view` now keeps a row whose effect size
  reads and whose p-value does not: it has an x coordinate, so it is drawn,
  never retained, and carries a null `pValue` that both surfaces count; only a
  row with no readable effect size is dropped. On the recorded compute that is
  201 points tested, 67 retained and 201 placed, one of them with no p-value.
  `EdaVariableResponse` and `EdaVariableOut` now carry `hideFrom`, read from
  the upstream variable in `variable_out`, so the tab can hide what the site
  hides while the chat tools keep every variable filterable.

* **EDA batch 6 is closed: the tab exists.** `/{siteId}/conversation/{id}/eda`
  mounts `features/eda/EdaWorkbench` behind the same `ChatShell` yield the
  strategy canvas uses. A `StudyPicker` searches and binds; a bound analysis
  mounts three cells keyed by `analysisId` so a switch remounts them: the
  `SubsetCell` (entity tree built from the flat detail, one `/count` per
  entity, filter editor dispatching on the server's `filterType`, chips from
  the store's parsed filters, unparsed filters reported, bar or histogram
  sparkline by `dataShape` with a coverage line), the `ComputeCell`
  (differential expression config built from live metadata with `DESeq` or
  `limma` on the wire, submit-or-poll by the byte-identical `run-compute`
  body, seven job states named), and the `VizCell` (volcano thresholded
  client side with a test proving zero `/viz` calls on a threshold change,
  the selected-gene readout beside every chart, scatter from the same
  cloud, the other charts named unavailable, refetch keyed on the completed
  job). `ExportStepButton` gates on `canExportRows` and a complete job and
  presents two success states with exact copy: the export began the
  strategy, or it added a draft root that is not pushed, decided
  structurally from the returned strategy and linked through the new
  `strategyCanvasUrl`. Before the batch, three reconciliations landed so it
  coded against the wire and not a sketch: every EDA response field became
  required (above), an export on a thread with no strategy now begins it
  through the one `persisted_graph` loader that replaced three divergent
  copies (the strict one in `strategy_ops` was the 404), with the op
  algebra's `ApplyError` rendered as 422 where it was an unhandled 500, and
  the frozen e2e journey's fixtures were corrected to the generated shapes.
  The verifier failed the first pass on evidence: local cell state outlived
  an analysis switch (measured "Sample6 of 12" after the switch), a second
  compute never refreshed the volcano (0 `/viz` calls), a Retry was missing,
  six named states had no test, and three probes survived; every item was
  fixed and re-probed, 18 of 18 killed on the second pass. Lead rulings
  recorded as backlog: the tab must honor `hideFrom` once the route carries
  it; the read path's refusal of an out-of-vocabulary filter needs a way out
  of the error state; no production path emits `data-eda.viz`, which batch 7
  owns. Ladders: unit 3223, integration 644 with 78 skipped, acceptance 56
  of 56 and 31 of 31, frontend 2512 vitest with the EDA tree at 187, three
  Python packages format-clean, `batch67-parts` red as designed.

* **Every EDA response field is required, and the analysis state counts its
  own entities.** The defaults are gone from the five parts in
  `shared_py.stream_parts.eda` and from every response model in
  `transport/http/schemas/eda.py`; a field that can legitimately be absent is
  required-and-nullable (`revision`, `pValue`, `adjustedPValue`, `job`,
  `step`, the gene-entity keys), and the request models keep the inputs a
  client may omit. `openapi.json` lists all thirteen `EdaAnalysisState` keys,
  the generated types and zod schemas carry no optional marker, and the store
  and the three card renderers read the fields with no `??`.
  `services/eda/authoring.py::subset_entity_counts` walks the study in tree
  order and fills `entityCounts`, which the only producer left empty; the
  whole size of an entity is cached beside its study detail
  (`catalog.py::unfiltered_entity_count`), so a mutation costs one count per
  entity and not two. `analysis_state` became async to own that read, so the
  subset predicates now run on the read path as well: an analysis edited
  elsewhere into an out-of-vocabulary value is refused by name rather than
  reported as a subset of zero, which is what upstream would answer. This
  closes the backlog item the batch-5 verifier raised.

* **EDA batch 5 is closed: the charts and the store exist, and the wire
  feeds both.** `lib/components/charts` is one ECharts 6.1.0 registry
  (`echartsRegistry.ts` holds the only value imports; everything else is
  `import type`), a ref-callback `EChart` wrapper that inits once, re-applies
  options and disposes in its own teardown, and pure option builders for the
  volcano (three series plus threshold guides, null p-values dropped and
  counted), the histogram and bar (label union, zero fill, real overlay), and
  the scatter (finite pairs only), each pinned to exact option arrays and
  tooltip strings. `lib/eda/volcanoSelection.ts` is the one selection rule
  (effect inclusive, significance strict, up before down) and the acceptance
  suite sweeps it with properties. `state/eda.ts` is `useEdaStore`, whose
  `supersedes()` is the overview's reconcile rule verbatim (analysis switch
  wins and clears, null revision on either side takes the last write, `>=`
  accepts), filters parsed per entry with the generated `edaFilterSchema`
  and failures counted. `lib/api/eda.ts` wraps the six routes and the GET
  through `requestJson` with generated schemas only; the three batch-4
  renderers hydrate the store in render with no effect. Two reconciliations
  landed inside the batch: `GET /conversations/{id}/eda` now carries the same
  `analysis: EdaAnalysisState | null` the part and the PATCH carry, built by
  one `read_analysis_state` that does not bump the revision (its seven flat
  fields deleted, `descriptor` made required-nullable), and the regenerated
  `conversationEdaResponseSchema` was adopted by the transport tests in the
  same window. The verifier ran twenty mutation probes and killed twenty,
  accepted eight implementer deviations on evidence (a namespace import of
  `echarts/core` because a named `use` trips the hooks lint; generated
  names over the card's), and left three notes the lead resolved: the
  palette backlog understated `--chart-3` (it fails the band, the entry now
  says so), the transport acceptance and the card spelled the compute
  payload `{appName, config}` where the wire says `{type, configuration}`
  (both corrected, the lead's one acceptance edit this batch), and the
  generated `EdaAnalysisState` marks nine always-filled fields optional
  because the Python model defaults them, which is now a backlog decision
  and a batch-6 wire truth (read the analysis through the store, never with
  `??` off a payload). Ladders: unit 3193, integration 640 with 78 skipped,
  acceptance 56 of 56, frontend 2340 vitest with batch-5 store, selection
  and transport at 31 of 31 and `batch67-parts` red as designed, four frozen
  trees byte-identical to the baseline.

* **EDA batch 4 is closed: the tab has its API and its types.**
  `transport/http/routers/eda.py` serves the seven pinned operations under
  the real `require_registered_wdk_identity` gate: study search and detail
  (one `describe_study` builder shared with the chat tool), count and
  distribution refusing an out-of-vocabulary value with 422 before any wire
  call, the thresholded volcano view, and `GET|PATCH
  /conversations/{id}/eda` with a five-way `action` union whose handlers
  call the same service bodies the agent tools call (`bind_analysis`,
  `apply_filters`, `submit_compute`, `export_analysis_step` were extracted
  into `services/eda/` so the tab and the tools cannot drift), every
  mutation bumping the thread's revision, and a `{analysis, job, step}`
  envelope with `analysis` required-and-nullable. On the TypeScript side
  one `yarn generate:types` carries the three `data-eda.*` part payloads,
  the six route schemas and, after `EdaFilter` became a PEP 695 `type`
  alias so Pydantic names it, the seven-variant `edaFilterSchema` the
  frozen store suite imports; the three text-only renderers keep the
  data-part map total. Ring 2 rejected once on evidence, and it was the
  batch's most important catch: the router shipped with a weaker
  session-presence gate because the implementer's test fixtures had not
  requested the harness's identity override that every other WDK-backed
  route test uses, so production was widened to fit a fixture omission on
  a security boundary; the verifier proved the real gate passes 10/10 and
  32/32 under the override, the gate was restored, the session gate and
  its tables deleted, and the decision doc's inaccurate paragraph
  reverted. The lead's one acceptance edit for the batch was that same
  fixture on the frozen suite. Two semantics the verifier traced are
  recorded for batch 6 rather than hidden: an export beside an existing
  strategy is a detached, never-pushed second root, and an export on a
  thread with no strategy is a 404. Ladders: unit 3191, http+eda
  integration 251, acceptance 56 of 56 (batch 4 at 10/10 under the real
  gate), frontend 2229 vitest with the acceptance config still all-skipped,
  the protocol package unchanged across three regenerations.

* **EDA batch 3 is closed: the conversational seam works end to end.** A
  researcher's thread can now search studies, open an analysis, set filters
  through a validated sheet, preview the subset, run differential expression
  as a durable background compute, and export the result as an ordinary
  step. The pieces: three `data-eda.*` stream parts in `shared_py` composed
  into the product's registration beside the strategy parts; seven Lead
  tools (`ai/tools/standalone/eda_*.py`, `ai/tools/toolsets/eda.py`) with
  `set_eda_filters` copying the `set_criterion` sheet pattern and every
  mutation bumping a per-thread revision counter on the new
  `conversation_analyses` row (migration `2026_08_28_0002`); the
  `services/eda/binding.py` hub; `create_eda_step` bridging into
  `apply_operations_and_commit` with the spec serialized once through
  `services/eda/export.py`; and `run_eda_compute` as a `@durable_tool`
  whose worker impl (`jobs/impls/eda_compute_impl.py`) drives the compute
  to `complete` before any step exists, so the WDK bridge's HTTP 202 is
  never surfaced. `durable_tool` was generalized to a two-member
  `DurableIdentity` Protocol so the Lead can call it. The proof is Verifier
  2's in-tree scripted conversation (`tests/integration/eda/test_eda_conversation.py`)
  through the real chat endpoint, worker, graph and event writer, asserting
  persisted chunk kinds and values (revisions 1 then 2, counts 4011 of 4279,
  a graph snapshot with a `GenesByEdaSubset` node), plus a live lane that
  pushed WDK strategy 330555673 whose EDA-backed step counted 5556 genes.
  Ring 2 rejected on evidence six times and each was closed by a named
  test: an unpinned longitude filter type, a vacuous hideFrom test whose
  fixture held no hidden variable, a non-atomic-increment mutant that
  returned 1 for all 20 concurrent calls, a significance-only threshold
  that escaped as a raw ValueError, a card-prescribed `import as`, and a
  duplicate view model. One verifier premise was refuted by the implementer
  with evidence (pydantic-ai dumps tool returns by alias, so the camelCase
  docstrings were right) and turned into a guard test. Docker crashed
  mid-batch from host-disk exhaustion (36 GB pruned; the killed implementer
  was resumed from an inventory of its tree). Recorded for later: the
  pre-existing resume-replay duplicate now measurably double-applies an EDA
  compute; the generic and per-dataset subset searches counted 5556 against
  5602 for one filter; the chat SSE test helper splits on U+2028. Full
  ladders green: unit 3177, serialized integration 594 passed 78 skipped,
  acceptance 46 of 47 (batch 4 pending), runtime package 354 with zero EDA
  names.

* **The plasmodb live lanes from EDA batches 1 and 2 have now run.**
  plasmodb.org returned after a day-long outage on their side, and every
  deferred live assertion passed on the first credentialed run: the client
  lane against the recorded catalog and counts (4011 of 4279), the compute
  lane reproducing the measured 5511 rows to 1543 retained (529 up, 1014
  down) at 1.0/0.05, and the search census (68 spec-carrying searches, 13
  named Eda, exactly 1 inert). One drift check failed for a true reason and
  was narrowed: a `user_submitted` study the veupathdb.org portal lists is
  invisible on plasmodb.org, because user uploads are visible per project
  and per account, so the recorded-is-a-subset-of-live assertion now
  compares curated studies only. Both batches' open items are closed.

* **EDA batch 2 is closed: the services exist.** `services/eda/catalog.py`
  resolves a dataset to its study through `/permissions` only (never derived
  from the id) and caches each study's detail under `study_cache_key`, the
  content hash for a curated study and `lastModified` for a user study, so
  a reloaded study re-fetches; `integrations/embeddings/study_index.py`
  ranks studies with the same fastembed index the WDK catalog uses, its
  three cache helpers now shared rather than copied, and never resolves.
  `services/eda/authoring.py` owns the analysis document: `serialize_spec`
  is the one `model_dump_json` site (an empty analysis serializes to the
  empty string, never `{}`; a frozen allowlist test fails on any second
  dump across six source trees), `EdaStepRequest` refuses a spec whose
  `studyId` differs from `eda_dataset_id` (both dataset ids), and
  `verified_count`/`apply_filters` run the domain predicates before any
  wire call because upstream answers an out-of-vocabulary value with 200
  and count 0. `services/eda/compute.py` submits with the STUDY id, polls
  the six-state job, and `retained_summary` applies the WDK bridge's exact
  volcano rule (a verifier replayed the recorded statistics by hand: 67
  retained of 201, 33 up and 34 down). `services/catalog/eda_backed.py`
  detects an EDA-backed search by parameter presence, never by name, and
  guards the `EDAUD_` upload sentinel so an empty-state vocabulary term is
  never offered as a choice. The frozen batch-2 acceptance module passes
  19/19 unmodified. The lead made its one allowed acceptance edit: the
  suite and the plan had constructed `WDKVocabTerm` with keyword arguments,
  but the model is the WDK wire triple, and an implementer's attempt to
  widen the production model to fit the test was rejected and reverted.
  Two verifier FAILs were closed on evidence (a sentinel word boundary and
  a guidance wiring path each survived a mutation until a test was added),
  a root fix typed `WDKSearch.dynamic_attributes` as `list[WDKAttributeField]`
  in place of a pre-existing `hasattr` probe, and the catalog integration
  file went from 47.75 s to 8.9 s by sharing one embedding cache across its
  tests. Open, not blocking: the live 5511-to-1543 assertion and the live
  search census have still not run because plasmodb.org is unreachable.

* **EDA batch 1 is closed: the integration foundation exists.**
  `integrations/eda/` now holds the hand-written Pydantic mirror of the EDA
  wire (`models.py`: the six-member variable union, the seven-member filter
  union that refuses `stringPrefixSet`, the analysis document with
  `derivedVariables` as ids, the six-state job, volcano rows that tolerate a
  missing p-value), eleven live-recorded fixtures with a value-pinning
  validation sweep, the typed httpx client (`client.py`, `analyses.py`,
  `errors.py`, `factory.py`; Accept exactly `application/json`, the STUDY id
  on computes, 400/403/422/500 mapped to typed errors, a missing registered
  token refused before the wire) hanging off `SiteInfo.eda_base_url`
  (`{site_origin}/eda`, no new setting), and `domain/eda.py`, the pure
  predicates over structural Protocols (filters against a study tree, the
  one-`VEUPATHDB_GENE_ID` rule, the differential-expression config) with an
  A-to-C cross-check proving the wire models satisfy them under pyright.
  Three Opus implementers, two Fable verifiers, then the lead. The protocol
  earned its keep on the first batch: Verifier 2 failed the predicates on
  evidence (two surviving mutations, six `match` arms statically dead to
  pyright because payload Protocols did not extend the base, an untested
  longitude epsilon) and the reopen surfaced a real behavior gap, a
  `category` variable accepted as a comparator; Verifier 1's twelve probes
  all died bar one killed only by the frozen acceptance suite, which is the
  suite doing its job. Open, not blocking: the credentialed plasmodb live
  lane has never run because plasmodb.org has been unreachable all day (its
  four pinned values were confirmed against veupathdb.org, the same
  deployment); re-run it when the host returns.

* **An edit turn is a delta over the strategy that exists, and a rebuild over
  one is refused.** Batches E4 to E6 of
  [the edit_strategy fix plan](../design/2026-08-27-edit-strategy-fix-plan.md)
  landed, and `edit_strategy` stopped being a classification nothing reads.
  `domain/strategy/spec_to_operations.py::operations_for` turns the computed
  `SpecDiff` into `GraphOperation`s over the live graph and hands them to the
  commit pipeline that already existed, so an untouched step is not rewritten.
  A build now re-keys the spec on the step ids it minted, which is what lets a
  criterion address a step at all; a thread that never framed gets the same
  invariant from the hydration. `build_strategy` refuses a thread whose graph
  has steps.

  Measured on PlasmoDB, one turn at a time through the debugger with the LLM
  mocked and WDK real. Turn 1 built strategy 330555313: `GenesByText` on
  P. falciparum 3D7 as WDK step 440180863 (129), `GenesByTaxon` on the same
  organism as 440180873 (5720), the UNION as 440180883. Turn 2 asked to swap
  the taxon criterion to P. vivax P01 and keep the rest. After it, WDK reports
  the same three step ids, `440180863` still carrying
  `text_search_organism: ["Plasmodium falciparum 3D7"]` at 129, and `440180873`
  carrying `organism: ["Plasmodium vivax P01"]` at 6861. No step was created and
  none was deleted. The ledger's diff read `kept 1, changed 1, added 0,
  dropped 0`, and the reply's preservation sentence is written from it.

  The same run found the debugger coupling two unrelated things: `--mock` set
  the mock provider AND skipped the WDK login, so a mocked run could not push a
  step and the proof had nothing to preserve. Only the LLM is mocked now; the
  login runs whenever credentials are present.

  Recorded as [an edit is a delta, not a
  rebuild](decisions/an-edit-is-a-delta-not-a-rebuild.md) and [a criterion and
  its step are one address](decisions/a-criterion-and-its-step-are-one-address.md).
  [build_strategy is not
  revision-guarded](decisions/build-strategy-is-not-revision-guarded.md) is
  amended: the exposure it accepted is closed, because the tool it applied to
  no longer runs on a strategy that exists. The checkpoint flush E3 owed shipped
  as `2026_08_28_0001`.

  Three backlog items left: the edit turn that dropped a criterion and said the
  rest was preserved, the one that rebuilt every step and reverted a hand edit,
  and the hydrated spec that made a whole strategy rebuildable with new step
  ids. A fourth left by accident: a formatter run over `src/pathfinder/tests/`
  reformatted the three EDA acceptance files ladder P's format rung was red on,
  which is the fix that item prescribed but not on its own, as it asked. Three
  arrived: the Lead has no tool to throw a strategy away now that
  `build_strategy` refuses one, the eval corpus cannot express a two-turn edit
  case, and the file-size gate is red on six modules rather than the two the
  item named.

* **The EDA plan gained a frozen acceptance layer, and it is already written.**
  [The overview](eda/plan/overview.md) now defines the protocol: a
  behavior-only conformance suite written before any implementation by QA
  agents who implement nothing, pinning live-verified VALUES at stable
  boundaries, pending until each batch closes (backend: `eda_acceptance`
  marker deselected from the default `addopts` plus `importorskip`; frontend:
  `*.acceptance.ts` files outside the default vitest include with a dedicated
  config; e2e: an env-gated playwright project), under a no-edit rule -
  implementers never touch the acceptance paths, a wrong test escalates to
  the session lead - and a new universal exit criterion: a batch closes only
  when its acceptance module passes unmodified. Verifiers additionally run
  mutation probes: flip two or three behavior-bearing lines and confirm the
  implementer's tests die. The suites exist and are pending-clean today:
  56 backend tests across four batch modules
  (`apps/api/src/pathfinder/tests/acceptance/eda/`, 4 modules skipped
  cleanly, every default gate green) and 41 frontend tests plus 3 e2e
  journeys (`apps/web/src/acceptance/eda/`, `apps/web/e2e/acceptance/`,
  default vitest and playwright collect zero of them). The QA pass also
  hardened the batch documents: the repository gained its named `increment`
  method, the 401 mapping and `install_transport` became pinned interface,
  unbind became explicitly idempotent, the count-route seam contradiction
  was resolved onto `verified_count`, `analysis` in the PATCH envelope is
  required-and-nullable, the volcano `selected` ordering is up-then-down,
  and batch 7's e2e snippets now use the rail's real accessible names.

* **The EDA integration has a verified implementation plan.** [eda/plan/](eda/plan/)
  holds an [overview](eda/plan/overview.md) - the layering, the co-edited-SSOT
  design (one analysis per thread, agent tools and tab clicks patching the
  same upstream document, both surfaces re-rendering from
  `data-eda.analysis-state` snapshots with a per-binding revision counter),
  the pinned shared contract, and the three-ring verification protocol - plus
  seven batch documents with per-implementer TDD task cards (17 implementers,
  10 verifiers, lead-closed batches). Drafted by two agents, then reconciled
  by the lead: the `PATCH /conversations/{id}/eda` route became a five-action
  union (`bind`, `set-filters`, `run-compute` as idempotent submit-or-poll,
  `export-step`, `unbind`) whose handlers call the same service bodies the
  agent tools call; the part payloads were settled on batch 3's models and
  every frontend fixture realigned; `VolcanoThresholds` gained its one
  definition; the duplicate distribution response collapsed onto the part's
  shape; and a boxplot chart with no data source and no consumer left the
  contract. Decisions taken with the user: both seams in one plan, ECharts
  for the statistical charts (canvas for the 5.5k-point volcano; networks
  stay on ReactFlow), co-edited state over read-only viewing. Execution is
  the one backlog initiative, which left the backlog when batch 7 closed.

## 2026-08-27

* **The availability cluster is closed: what a process holds is bounded, the
  server binds before the warm-up finishes, and an abandoned MCP call stops
  with its caller.** Three measured defects had one shared cause. Twelve of the
  fourteen catalog snapshots the image ships were 84.8 days old, and nothing
  persisted a refreshed one: every process start restored fourteen stale
  snapshots, spawned fourteen background refreshes at once, and each refetched
  a site and re-encoded its index - which is where the worker's 5.26 GiB, the
  api's hour-plus cold start and the `wdk-mcp` kill on a stale-cache site all
  came from. `catalogs_cache` now mounts over `apps/api/src/data/catalogs` in
  all three services, beside the `embeddings_cache` volume that already held
  the encoded rows, so a refresh is paid once and not once per recreate; a
  process-wide semaphore admits one `_fetch_from_api` at a time and a
  `KeyedLock` one build per site, so the peak is one build and not fourteen;
  `CATALOG_REFRESH_ENABLED` is `false` on `worker` and on `wdk-mcp`, because a
  build of one site was measured at 2.977 GiB and neither 2 GiB container
  survives it, and a sweep inside `wdk-mcp` restores a fresh-snapshot site in
  0.3 s for about 10 MiB; and `DiscoveryService` holds its catalogs in a
  `cachetools.LRUCache` over
  `SITE_CATALOG_BUDGET_MB` accounted megabytes (512 by default), so the held
  set is bounded by policy rather than by a kill. The accounting is measured,
  not guessed: a 7.9 MB plasmodb snapshot restores in 0.4 s with nothing
  encoded and costs 27.6 to 29.9 MiB resident, so a catalog is charged
  `1 MiB + 4 * payload + index.nbytes`. The lifespan now spawns
  `_warm_up_subsystems` instead of awaiting it and the model loads inside it
  run on a thread, so uvicorn binds while the catalogs load behind it: measured
  against the 73 minutes the item recorded, a recreate bound 43 s after
  container start and all fourteen catalogs preloaded in 5 s with nothing
  encoded, and the api settled at 2.21 GiB against the 5.66 to 8.83 GiB read
  off the same container before. The container healthcheck is `/health`,
  because a compose dependent needs a server that answers and a catalog loads
  on demand. `/health/ready` still reports per-subsystem and per-site progress for
  the UI's startup gate. On the MCP side a stateless streamable-HTTP call runs
  in the session manager's own task group, so an abandoned call is cancelled by
  nothing and the tool has to ask: `rank_public_strategies_semantic` embeds 64
  strategies per call and scores each batch as it arrives, and
  `search_example_plans` passes an embedding function that refuses once
  `Request.is_disconnected()` is true, holding that site's lock for the whole
  call so a second caller queues. Measured against the served endpoint: three
  calls abandoned at a five second budget all stopped about seven seconds after
  their clients left, the container kept `RestartCount` 0 at 1.089 GiB, the
  next call answered 200, and a patient client got its ranking in 46.2 s.
  `_encode` in the semantic index batches the same way, and the model now takes
  one document per batch: fastembed pads a batch to its longest text, and
  encoding 64 toxodb descriptions cost 166.5 s and 886 MiB at `batch_size=8`
  against 128.9 s and 186 MiB at `batch_size=1`. The eight-site sweep the
  kernel killed on its third site now finishes at 1375.8 MiB. Family 5 of the
  admission record names `search_example_plans` as the slow tool with a five
  second budget and settles all four of its checks, so three entries leave
  `UNSETTLED_CHECKS`. Recorded as
  [per-site catalogs are evicted under a budget, and the warm-up does not block
  the bind](decisions/per-site-catalogs-are-evicted-and-the-warm-up-does-not-block-the-bind.md),
  which names what was rejected: one process holding every index and serving
  the rest over MCP, parallel per-site encoding, a rebuild inside a capped
  container, `/health/ready` as the container healthcheck, and a budget sized
  from process RSS. One finding did not fit the fix and is now its own item:
  thirteen of the fourteen shipped `.npz` caches carry the retired
  `embeddings`-plus-`hash` shape that `_load_cached_rows` skips, so 7184 of the
  7699 shipped catalog entries have no usable row and a fresh deployment
  encodes them all before readiness closes.

* **The EDA bundle grew from orientation to a full specification.** Four
  parallel research passes deepened [EDA](eda/) from 4 documents to 13, every
  claim verified against commit-pinned upstream source or live calls on three
  deployments, then re-verified by a second pass. New:
  [data model](eda/data-model.md) (66664 variables scanned; the single-entity
  GET is lossy; `isCategory` never on the wire),
  [subsetting semantics](eda/subsetting-and-tabular.md) (cross-entity
  propagation proven in both directions and across sibling subtrees;
  root-vocab is not subset-sensitive; a 20-row preview tier),
  [filter algebra](eda/filters.md) (all 7 deployed types with exact error
  classes; out-of-vocabulary values return 200 count 0),
  [derived variables and merging](eda/derived-variables-and-merging.md)
  (12 plugins, 10 proven live; `relativeObservationMinTimeInterval` is dead
  upstream; `resultsAll` gates merge output with 403),
  [computes and jobs](eda/computes-and-jobs.md) (job id is a client-derivable
  MD5 shared across users; a real DESeq run observed queued to complete),
  [visualizations](eda/visualizations.md) (volcano thresholds are
  client-side, network thresholds server-side),
  [notebook presets](eda/notebook-presets.md) (the compute bridge is
  volcano-only by construction; the delayed answer is HTTP 202
  WDK-DELAYED-RESULT and the WDK call auto-starts the job; WGCNA exports
  genes through plain SQL, not EDA),
  [genomics and WDK relations](eda/genomics-and-wdk-relations.md) (four
  relations, not one; per-dataset searches derive from
  SHA-1(datasetName)[:10]; the EDAUD_ sentinel vocabulary term 400s), and
  [architecture fit](eda/pathfinder-architecture-fit.md) (layer placement,
  the durable-tool mapping named mechanism by mechanism, EDA as a second
  admitted MCP source, hand-written Pydantic mirrors with pinned wire
  samples). The four baseline documents were corrected where the deeper pass
  falsified them, most notably: `differentialexpression` takes
  identifier+value variables, not a collection; the per-dataset searches use
  `GenesByEdaSubsetGeneric`; user studies have an empty `sha1hash`.

* **A one-agent assistant reads the thread it is having.** `single_agent_graph`
  built every run from `state.user_prompt` alone and passed no history unless
  the turn answered an approval, so a site-help thread answered "Yes, please
  proceed." with "What would you like me to proceed with?". The turn state now
  carries the thread's own pydantic-ai messages as JSON, written from the run's
  result and trimmed to the last complete exchange, and the graph reads them
  back as the run's `message_history`
  ([a one-agent turn runs over the thread's own messages](decisions/the-thread-carries-its-own-messages-across-turns.md)).
  The trim is what keeps a parked approval out of the carried history:
  pydantic-ai refuses a new prompt over a history holding an unprocessed call,
  and the card keeps its own resume history regardless. Rebuilding the messages
  from the durable chunk log was rejected, because the wire carries chunks
  rather than the call-to-result pairing a provider needs; a runtime window or
  summarizer was rejected too, since no thread has yet measured too expensive
  and pydantic-ai already puts that bound on the agent. The runtime's scripted
  test model gained `current_turn`, so a script that asks what THIS turn did
  stops reading the turns before it.

## 2026-08-25

* **A regenerated turn no longer wedges its conversation, and a thread that
  cannot render no longer takes the page with it.** The dispatcher wrote the
  user's envelope on every turn, so a regenerate - which sends the thread back
  ending at the same user message - put that id in the log twice, and
  assistant-ui refused to build a thread that names one message twice. It now
  appends through `append_user_message_once`, which reads the log first and
  writes nothing when the id is already there, and the id decides rather than
  the client's `trigger`, as section 12.3 requires
  ([one id names one message in the log](decisions/one-id-names-one-message-in-the-log.md)).
  Four conversations on the dev database already held a repeat, so
  `reduceSnapshot` keeps the first message an id names and drops a later one:
  the reported conversation's 1,624-chunk log rebuilds as three messages, one
  question and both answers, with no repeated id. A unique index and a repair
  pass were both rejected, because neither can be applied to a log that already
  repeats an id without editing what was said. `ChatView` also wraps its body
  in an error boundary, so any thread that throws renders the error and a
  site-scoped way back to the conversation list instead of an application-error
  page.

* **MCP program batch G: an assistant that is not PathFinder answers with tools
  served over the network, and the program is reconciled.** `site_help`
  declares one source - two catalog reads and one control-test measurement from
  `veupathdb-wdk-mcp`, `required=False`, so a deployment that admits no such
  server still serves the assistant - and reaches it through its own typed
  per-turn channel rather than a widened runtime factory, because the graph is
  compiled before the turn's sources resolve
  ([a declared source reaches a one-agent assistant through its deps](decisions/a-declared-source-reaches-a-one-agent-assistant-through-its-deps.md)).
  A site-help turn driven through the worker answered from a tool the wdk-mcp
  container served over the compose network, and the source's one writing tool
  parks a card that the next request's answer runs - which is the program's
  whole claim: an assistant declares a source and the runtime does the rest.
  Two runtime defects are backlog items, neither in the source path:
  `single_agent_graph` builds every run from `state.user_prompt` alone, so a
  one-agent assistant forgets the previous turn; and a resumed approval turn
  emits `tool-input-available` with no `tool-input-start`, which the strict
  client tolerates and PROTOCOL 6.2 does not describe. A third finding - a
  suite-order red blamed on the runtime - was disproven by the review: the
  test double's in-process uvicorn installed process signal handlers that
  latch sse_starlette's process-global shutdown flag; the double no longer
  captures signals, and the ladder is order-independent again.

  The closing sweep found the bundle already honest: the six items the program
  touched are deleted or edited to their residual, the backlog index and its
  directory agree file for file, and every decision the program recorded is
  indexed. The three dated documents that outlived their claims are annotated,
  not rewritten. The execution plan's status line reads executed and points
  here; the design document's section 8 and appendix B carry dated notes, since
  four of appendix B's seven findings have closed and one of them closed before
  the program began; and the platform assessment's addendum carries the WS4
  entry with the two corrections its own debts paragraph needed - a failed turn
  is visible after a reload, and the max-lines gate is red on two modules
  rather than five.

* **MCP program batches E and F: the suite a foreign team can run, and the
  packages publish alone.** `packages/mcp-conformance` ships 32 checks in six
  families as a pytest plugin that never imports pathfinder or
  assistant_core, proven by fifteen planted defects that each name their
  exact failing checks; run against our own served endpoint it answers
  `incomplete` honestly - 26 passed, none failed, six unsettled checks
  pinned by name - and its first real run surfaced three defects
  (an ortholog vocabulary shape the domain model refuses, an abandoned slow
  call that outlives its client and OOM-kills the server, the file-size gate
  red at HEAD), each now a measured backlog item. Nightly, CI and pre-commit
  lanes carry it. On the packaging side, assistant-core shed its last
  product dependency and installs into a clean venv with pathfinder absent;
  the client builds a dist whose tarball proves the three rings (core and
  legacy import with zero dependencies, the ai-sdk ring requires `ai` and
  only `ai`); `data-turn-failed` joined the protocol at 1.3.0 so a reloaded
  thread finally says the turn died, deduplicated against the live error
  card; and the task card left the per-task SSE dialect - the thread carries
  the whole lifecycle, the reattach fires at task start because a
  completion-fired design is provably impossible, and the fan-out lane
  collapse that removal exposed is a filed item, not a surprise. One review
  round each: the conformance dev-dependency had broken the api image build
  (three COPY lines), and one spec header still described the deleted
  subscription. Fable review: both accepted.

* **MCP program batch D: veupathdb-wdk-mcp is served.** Sixteen tools over
  streamable HTTP in a container of their own on the api image, binding in
  about three seconds because the entrypoint preloads nothing. Fourteen
  declare readOnly; the two writers declare non-destructive with per-tool
  `_meta` call budgets the live suite enforces by setting the client's
  read timeout from the served declaration - enrichment measured 508.9 s at
  the 200-gene cap against its declared 600, and the controls estimate held
  at under nine seconds against 180. Bearer auth chains the SDK's own
  middleware (the fastmcp shortcut silently drops the credential subclass,
  so the SDK path is pinned by a test that fails without the context
  middleware). Memory ceilings landed on the two growers (worker and
  wdk-mcp at 2 GiB, the api uncapped by measurement); sizing them
  reproduced the api OOM incident on purpose, and the live proof then
  showed a cold-site catalog read killing the served container at
  3.269 GiB - the eviction half stays in the backlog for batch F. The
  isolation case ran against a real foreign-owned public strategy and
  leaked neither the step nor its count. One review round: the server
  advertised fastmcp's version as its own; it now declares the
  deployment's, pinned at build and on the wire. Fable review: accepted.

* **MCP program batches B and C: the tool protocol lives in the runtime, and
  the sixteen tools' service seam exists.** `assistant_core/mcp/` now holds
  declarations, admission, the deny-by-default approval predicate, the
  untrusted-output wrapper with real jsonschema payload validation, the fixed
  wrapping order, and per-turn resolution: a declared source is built,
  credentialed at the transport and nowhere else, opened with the turn and
  closed with it, proven against an in-process FastMCP server with the
  design's P1 exit criteria each named in a test. The turn runner enters the
  resolution around the drive; a spec that declares nothing constructs
  nothing. The three sub-agents left their module singletons for
  per-dispatch factories. On the service side, the four gated catalog tools
  split into pure retrieval halves under `services/catalog/` with
  byte-identical wrapper behaviour pinned, `pathfinder/mcp/` gained bearer
  auth that reuses the api's verifier by identity plus the RFC 9728 document
  from the SDK's own helpers, and `enrich_gene_ids` runs enrichment by value
  through the same WDK plugin machinery with the wire field names pinned
  three ways. Fable review: both batches accepted with zero defects; the
  next batch inherits two measured corrections (the api venv lacks the
  fastmcp server extra, and the enrichment tool cannot fit the default
  60 s call budget).

## 2026-08-24

* **MCP program batch A: the trust base.** Three changes an external consumer
  of the runtime depends on, executed from the plan in
  `docs/design/2026-08-24-mcp-sdk-execution-plan.md`.

  **Every named tool is callable.** The gene chain VERIFY's instructions
  order (`literature_search`, `lookup_gene_records`,
  `resolve_gene_ids_to_records`) is registered on its toolset, the two
  catalog tools joined FRAME, and `update_search_decision` is deleted with
  its module. An agreement suite now walks every agent's instructions and
  the extractor registry and asserts each named tool is callable by that
  agent - it caught a fourth instance on EXECUTION and seven extractor
  orphans on the way, and the orphaned `SearchOverview` selection fields it
  exposed are a backlog item.

  **The deferred-tool cycle exists once.** The Lead's duplicated approval
  code folded onto `assistant_core.graph.approvals`: `parked_call` is the
  one construction of the shared fields, the Lead adds its product fields by
  `model_copy(update=...)`, and its thirty approval tests pass unchanged.
  The two resume helpers this file's earlier entry placed in `_lead_turn.py`
  now live in the runtime; the Lead keeps sub-agent re-entry, the
  dispatch-answer fan-out and `is_pure_approval` only.

  **The checkpoint allowlist is real.** It never was: with strict msgpack
  off, `with_msgpack_allowlist` returns the serializer unchanged, so every
  declared type was discarded and both hypotheses in the backlog item were
  wrong (the item leaves with the correction that `astream` warned
  identically). The serde now binds the allowlist at construction
  (decision recorded), `CombineOp` completes the PathFinder list, and an
  integration test reads a real thread under the library's serde-event
  listener and asserts zero unregistered-type events. Found on the way and
  filed: the api and package lockfiles resolve `langgraph-checkpoint` to
  4.0.1 and 4.2.0 under identical pins, and two api integration tests fail
  under machine load only.

* **Every tool an instruction or an extractor names is callable by the agent
  that reads it.** VERIFY told the model to resolve control gene IDs through
  `literature_search` then `lookup_gene_records` then
  `resolve_gene_ids_to_records`, and its toolset held none of the three, so a
  controls-needing verification spent a model turn on a tool that did not
  exist; all three are registered now. FRAME registers
  `browse_search_categories` and `list_transforms`, which the context extractor
  already claimed observations from. `update_search_decision` and its module
  are gone, superseded by the `set_criterion` flow, and the outage-rejection
  detector that was its only reader goes with them. A new agreement test walks
  each agent's instruction text and the extractor registry against the tools
  its toolsets register; it found a fourth case nobody had reported, EXECUTION
  naming `get_estimated_size` and `get_sample_records` under "Read-only
  inspection" while registering neither. The backlog item leaves with the fix;
  a new one records the six selection fields on `SearchOverview` that the
  deleted tool was the only writer for.

* **A rehydrated thread can keep talking: the request parses the protocol's
  own reduction output.** The snapshot reduction attaches `errors`, `aborted`
  and `finishReason` to an assistant message, and a live stream records
  `resultProviderMetadata` on an output-error tool part; pydantic-ai's strict
  message union refused both on resend, so any conversation whose history was
  rehydrated - a reload, a restore from dismissed, a branch - answered every
  later send with a 422 and the raw error list. `ChatRequestBody` now parses
  those members away in one before-validator, PROTOCOL.md 1.2.2 says a runtime
  MUST ignore them, and the restored-strategy e2e journey proves the turn end
  to end on a rebuilt stack. This closes the resend-brick investigation from
  the 2026-08-17 UI run; its backlog item leaves with it. `site_id` on the
  same body gained the String(50) bound the transport sweep gave every other
  request field.

* **The e2e mocks now speak the wire they test.** Five route-mocking specs
  sent `data:`-only SSE frames that section 3 of the protocol orders a client
  to reject, and parameter-sweep still spoke the pre-v6 `messages/partial`
  dialect against a dead per-task mock; all six now build their streams from
  one conformant fixture (`e2e/fixtures/sse.ts`) and pass. The "durable path
  never fires" scare dissolved with them: no e2e spec drives a real durable
  turn by design, and that coverage lives in the backend integration suites.
  What remains of the fourteen reds is worker contention on three feature
  specs that pass standalone, recorded with the adjudication in the residual
  item.

* **Every transport request string that lands in a bounded column is bounded.**
  One `SiteId` type now covers the five schemas the re-review flagged and the
  nine more a residual sweep found - body fields, write-path query params via
  `RequiredSiteIdQuery`, the auth routes' defaulted params - plus the gene-set
  and control-set name/searchName/recordType/source fields, each sized to its
  column, so an oversized value answers 422 at the edge instead of 500 at
  INSERT. Seventeen red-first cases pin the bounds; the spec and generated
  types carry them.

* **The stalled-turn releaser and the thread log survived their review.** The
  P2 verifier's findings, closed the same day: `_chat_stream_is_open` now
  reads only turn-tagged rows, so task progress written into the gap between
  turns neither reopens an ended turn nor hides a stalled one; `_ThreadLog`
  clears its pending update only when it wrote that update, so a concurrent
  scoped child's offer is no longer dropped while an append awaits the
  database; the first chat POST of a fresh test process paying the PIGuard
  model load against a 5 s enqueue ceiling is a backlog item with the
  measured runs.

## 2026-08-23

* **WS-V batch P1: the one-agent assistant can ask, and the loop guard finally
  runs.** Two mechanisms the runtime declared and never reached are now wired,
  each with the turn that proves it.

  **Approvals.** `single_agent_graph` admits `DeferredToolRequests` as a
  per-run output type, so a tool marked approval-required no longer reaches the
  user as "`DeferredToolRequests` is not among output types". The cycle lives
  in `assistant_core/graph/approvals.py` - park the call as a `PendingApproval`
  with the run's full history, rebuild `DeferredToolResults` from the user's
  answer, replay that history, and hand the emitter the hint that re-announces
  the call - and the graph runs it in about thirty lines. The phase a one-agent
  turn parks is `"agent"`, the name of the only node that can raise one; a
  one-agent assistant has one role and it is the graph's. A turn that answers
  nothing supersedes the card rather than re-running the call the user never
  approved. Nine package cases drive request, approve, deny, the parked state
  and the superseded card end to end, and three more do it over HTTP in
  `apps/api` with a site-help-shaped assistant whose one tool needs confirming,
  through the route, the worker and the resume. `site_help`'s own tools are
  read-only and stay silent.

  **The repetition guard.** `ToolRepetitionGuard.check` had no caller since
  batch C. It now runs from `RepetitionGuard`, an `AbstractCapability` the
  driver passes per run, on the guard the turn's deps carry - the same
  interception surface `ToolResilience` uses, chosen because the Lead's tools
  are registered with `tools=` and no toolset wrapper can see them. Both
  blocks return the refusal as the tool's ordinary result, never as a
  `ModelRetry` (a retry raised in the wrapper shares the tool's retry budget
  and can abort a run whose tool already retried); the first names the
  repetition so the model can route around it, the second sets
  `stopped_call_id` and the driver stops consuming the stream once that
  result has reached the client, so the turn ends with `finish`/`stop` and no
  dangling part. It is
  wired on the Lead, the three sub-agents and the single-agent graph, and the
  synthetic assistant grew a loop arc that asks for one reading five times: the
  third is refused, the fourth ends the turn, and the fifth is never made.

  Two things the wiring found. `graph_modifying_tools` was a constructor
  argument with no behaviour - both of `check`'s early branches reset the
  counter and return `None` - so it is gone and a tool outside the vocabulary
  is what clears a streak. And `READ_ONLY_TOOLS` named ten tools, nine of which
  no agent has carried since the FRAME/BUILD/VERIFY split; the guard would have
  watched `get_plan` and `search_catalog` forever. It now names the 26 real
  inspectors across the four agents, and a seam test fails when a watched name
  is not a tool some agent offers.

  `PROTOCOL.md` is **1.2.0**: section 6.2 states the approval cycle a turn
  really runs, the `error` example the reference assistant used to produce
  because of this defect is gone, and `tool-approval-request` is captured in
  its place. `@pathfinder/assistant-client` re-synced and its reducer already
  read both chunks; two conformance cases now say so. Devtools' loop diagnosis
  reports guard refusals, and one refusal is enough to name a loop, because the
  guard measured it rather than inferring it from a failure count.

  `lead_node.py` crossed the 400-line cap on the way, so model selection left
  it for `_lead_model.py` and the two approval-resume helpers joined the rest of
  the Lead's approval code in `_lead_turn.py`; the five known files are the only
  ones over the cap again.

  Verified: package `uv run pytest` 205 passed with no `pathfinder` installed,
  ruff, ruff-format, mypy --strict 54 files; `apps/api` ruff, mypy --strict 577
  files, pyright 0/0/0, import-linter 7 kept, 2626 unit tests, the integration
  suite; the client's 200 vitest cases; `openapi check` exit 0 and `yarn tsc`
  clean on the web app; knowledge gate 120 files.

* **The protocol grew a request side and stopped needing two readers.** PROTOCOL.md
  1.1.0 answers the two questions section 6.4 of the MCP/SDK design named as ours to
  close before an external client is written. The turn-start contract is section 12:
  the identity a request must prove, the `X-Requested-With` rule that applies to a
  cookie and not to a bearer, the body split into the nine fields any assistant on
  this runtime takes and the one this product adds, the approval answer that rides in
  the body instead of inventing a user message, the six refusals including the `409`
  a thread's fixed assistant produces, and the fact that the POST's response is a tail
  from the last turn terminator rather than a stream the turn depends on. Two request
  examples are on the page and a gate validates both through `ChatRequestBody`; a
  second gate asserts the two field tables together name every field the model
  accepts, so a field added without a row on the page fails.

  The durable-task half is its own subsection of section 6.
  `data-background-task-started` was already in the log; `data-task-progress` and
  `data-task-completed` are now written there too, untagged, so the chat stream
  carries them and a client that reads the thread learns the whole lifecycle with one
  reader and one cursor. Progress is coalesced - first
  update, every five-point advance, ten seconds of silence, and always the last one -
  because the alternative is on the order of 900 rows replayed on every read of a
  thread that once ran a sweep. The comparison is in whole percentage points, since
  `0.15 - 0.10` is `0.049999999999999996` and a fraction rule would skip the tick it
  names. The chunk carries the task id as its `id`, so however many are written the
  reduced message holds one part.

  The per-task endpoint keeps working byte for byte and is now written down rather
  than merely known: section 13 states its `event: stream` framing, its `custom`
  envelope, its missing cursor and the two payloads that differ from their logged
  counterparts, and an integration test pins its exact frames against that section.
  It is deprecated, `@pathfinder/assistant-client/legacy` says so, and the web app's
  migration is a backlog item rather than a break.

  All three gates were made to bite before they were trusted. Removing the
  `phaseReasoning` row from the document's core table failed the field-table test with
  "Extra items in the right set: 'phaseReasoning'"; adding one space inside the pinned
  legacy frame failed the golden test on that byte; renaming the changelog's newest
  row failed the new assistant-core test with `assert '1.2.0' in {'1.0.0', '1.1.0',
  '1.2.1'}`. All three were restored.

* **The published OpenAPI spec is the production contract, whatever the process environment.** `openapi check` answered 0 or 1 depending on who ran it: the generator built the app under the ambient profile, so a mock-profile shell put `/api/v1/dev/login` into `packages/spec/openapi.yaml` and a production shell then reported drift. `create_app` takes `include_dev_routes` (None follows settings; the generator passes False), the committed spec is regenerated without the dev route, and a unit test pins that a mock-profile environment still produces a spec with no `/api/v1/dev/` path.

* **WS-V batch 4: the eval system, and the consent that feeds it.** Consent is
  `users.eval_data_consent`, default on, with `eval_notice_seen_at` beside it so the
  one-screen notice is shown once per account rather than once per browser; both are
  read and written through `GET`/`PATCH /api/v1/me/privacy`. The notice renders over
  the app and is dismissible - Escape, the backdrop, **OK**, or the inline **Turn off**
  that opts out and records the notice in one call - and Settings gained a **Privacy**
  tab whose toggle disables and re-enables. Extraction is a daily `maintenance` task
  that reads finished threads of consenting users, strips email addresses and URL
  credentials, and writes `eval_staged_cases`; `EvalExtract` refuses to be constructed
  if either pattern survives, so an unredacted candidate cannot be queued. Curation is
  `pathfinder.devtools.evals`: `staged`, `show`, `promote`. A promoted case is a JSON
  file under `apps/api/src/pathfinder/evals/corpus/`, on the manifest-and-provenance
  shape the WDK fixture store introduced in batch 3. Every chunk in the extraction
  suites is built by the code that writes it to the log - `user_message_chunk`,
  `TextDeltaChunk`, `ledger_update_event` - so a renamed chunk kind fails the tests
  instead of quietly emptying the queue.

* **The linkage rule became a check constraint.** "Extraction severs user linkage" and
  "an opt-out clears the user's staged items" cannot both describe the same row, so the
  linkage was given a lifetime instead: a staged row names its user, its thread and its
  extract; promotion nulls all three and keeps the content hash, the corpus name, the
  site and the assistant. Any other combination is unwritable, and the foreign keys
  cascade, so deleting an account removes its staged rows with no code running while
  promoted cases are already out of reach. `DELETE /api/v1/user/data` reports
  `stagedEvalCases` beside its other counts. Recorded as
  [a staged eval case carries its user until promotion](decisions/a-staged-eval-case-carries-its-user-until-promotion.md).

* **The harness is pydantic-evals, and the promotion policy is written down.** The spike
  found `pydantic-evals` **2.22.0** already installed as a hard dependency of the pinned
  `pydantic-ai`, providing the dataset, the case loop, the evaluator protocol and the
  report; the run summary stays a local model so the SLI feed does not follow a library's
  dataclass. Four cases encoded from the cataloged UI-run failures ran **4/4 green in
  32.7 s** against the deterministic provider, and a case given a wrong
  expectation fails with its named difference rather than silently. One
  extraction pass over the development database read 50 threads and staged **6**
  candidates across four sites. `conventions/verification-gates.md` now
  carries the ruled policy: an eval starts as a tracked trend, becomes a hard gate only
  after it catches or would have caught a real regression and holds stable, and a flaking
  gate is demoted or deleted, never suppressed. Recorded as
  [the eval harness is pydantic-evals](decisions/the-eval-harness-is-pydantic-evals.md).

* **Two deviations and one finding.** Four cases rather than ten: the deterministic
  provider routes on keywords, so a case whose red comes from a test-double marker
  reports a regression that is not there. Exact structural match rather than NTED: the
  only tree-edit-distance implementation in the repo is in the retired thesis harness and
  depends on `zss`, `numpy` and `scipy`
  (the graded distance landed on 2026-08-30, written in plain Python). And reading a thread through
  `graph.aget_state` prints eleven "Deserializing unregistered type" warnings, including
  for three types that are on the allowlist `assistant_core.conversation.serde` builds,
  where the same checkpoint read by `astream` prints none
  ([fixed](decisions/the-checkpoint-allowlist-binds-at-construction.md)).

## 2026-08-22

* **WS-V batch 3: the science verifies in two lanes, and the WDK rule bundle has one
  unenforced entry left.** Per-PR: 31 of the 32 untested rules became hermetic tests over a
  pinned fixture store, so `check-wdk-rules` reports **78 enforced, 4 partial, 1
  unenforced** where it reported 32 unenforced, and three `PARTIAL` entries closed with it
  ([WDK-STRAT-002](wdk/rules/strategies-and-steps.md), `-003` and
  [WDK-MAP-003](wdk/rules/pathfinder-mapping.md), all three by one test that runs the
  projection to its third function and asserts on the serialized `WDKStepTree`). Nightly:
  `pytest -m live_wdk` collects **139** tests, skips cleanly with no credential, deletes
  every strategy and step it creates, and writes a JSON summary of outcomes, per-site
  tallies and drift. The recording path is `pathfinder.devtools.wdk_fixtures`: a
  declarative manifest of 12 exchanges, provenance stored as data rather than as a comment,
  and one command - `yarn wdk:record` - that refreshes the store a confirmed drift
  invalidates. The gate now fails a rule whose status is `UNENFORCED` and whose block
  carries no `reason`, so the column cannot fill with silence again.

* **Four defects the rules found, each in the code the rule anchors.**
  `get_duplicated_step_tree` parsed WDK's `{"stepTree": ...}` envelope with a model that
  declared no camelCase alias, so the only supported way to graft one strategy's branch
  into another raised on every call
  ([WDK-STRAT-007](wdk/rules/strategies-and-steps.md)). `StepValidation` defaulted `level`
  to `NONE` and `is_valid` to `True`, and `WDKStep.validation` defaulted to that model, so
  a step document carrying no validation object at all read as a positive claim of
  validity - both defaults are gone, and an absent bundle is now `None`
  ([WDK-VALID-001](wdk/rules/validation.md)). A 4xx body was truncated to 200 characters
  and its `byKey` messages discarded, where a validating endpoint answers with a validation
  bundle; `integrations/veupathdb/_failures.py` now parses it and carries the per-parameter
  messages on the error ([WDK-VALID-006](wdk/rules/validation.md)). And a `date-range`
  bound in any format was accepted locally and sent to WDK, where a badly formatted one is
  a **500** that names nothing ([WDK-PARAM-006](wdk/rules/parameters-and-vocabularies.md));
  a bound is now an ISO date or a local refusal. `step_status` also read `is_valid` without
  its level, so a `NONE` bundle - which WDK emits as `isValid: false` - read as INVALID.

* **The hidden-defaults sweep ran, and the answer is smaller and sharper than the question.**
  On plasmodb.org, **237** of 359 transcript searches carry a hidden required parameter with
  a published default (182 of 325 on 2026-08-14). Binding every published default, 19
  answered 200 and **exactly one returned zero rows**:
  `GenesByRNASeqpfal3D7_Lee_Gambian_ebi_rnaSeq_RSRCWGCNAModules`, on `eda_dataset_id` and
  `wgcnaDataset`. Of the 158 refusals, **not one names a hidden parameter** - every
  parameter WDK named is visible, `samples_percentile_generic` 77 times - so no hidden
  default was refused, and what blocks the remaining measurement is the visible half of
  [WDK-PARAM-010](wdk/rules/parameters-and-vocabularies.md). `channel` (75 searches) and
  `dataset_url` (56) stay unmeasured for that reason, and
  the hidden-required-defaults item now carries the
  numbers instead of the question.

* **The lane's first run found seven dead live tests, and they are fixed.** Every
  `live_wdk` suite under `tests/integration/strategies/` read the persisted plan off
  `Conversation.strategy_ast`, which moved to `ConversationStrategy` when the runtime
  became a package. The tests skip without a credential, so nothing had run them since;
  under the account all seven raised `AttributeError`. They read the projection now, and
  the whole lane - 94 rule and sentinel checks plus the 45 that existed - is **139 green**.

* **One live drift, measured rather than assumed.**
  [WDK-FILTER-006](wdk/rules/filters.md) recorded a **400** naming the column when
  `byValue` is applied where the record-type document advertises it and the step will not
  take it. On 2026-08-22 the same four columns answer **500 `Internal Error`**, and
  `gene_product` still answers 200. The refusal holds, the diagnosis is gone, and a 500 is
  retried three times where the 400 was refused at once. Guest reads have also closed:
  `GET /record-types/transcript/searches/...` is a **401** without a registered token,
  which is why the recording command needs `VEUPATHDB_AUTH_TOKEN` and why the bundle's
  "most live checks need no credential" note no longer holds.

* **WS-V batch 2: the runtime proves the conversation works, and the wire has a written spec.** `packages/assistant-core/tests/synthetic.py` is a complete `AssistantSpec` built from runtime code alone - `single_agent_graph` over bare `TurnState`, an `Agent` whose model is a `ScriptedModel` with four arcs (plain answer, `add` tool call, an approval-required `wipe_everything`, and a `stop_turn` that sets the cancel from inside the run), a `UsageLedger` as the `charge_usage` hook, and a `turn_epilogue`. The suite drives it through the package's public surfaces only, so 128 tests became **192**: turn lifecycle (the graph's chunks reach `conversation_events`, reduce to the `UIMessage` a client renders, and leave one `messages` row whose `usage.totalTokens` equals what the ledger was charged), durability (a reader that reconnects at cursor N gets the remainder **byte for byte**, cursors are strictly increasing and unique, the snapshot equals the live accumulation, two turns split cleanly on `done`), resume (a turn with `is_resume=True` names no prompt field at all, so `turn_input` omits it and the checkpointed prompt survives - the resumed turn answers from it), cancellation, cost, tenancy (two threads driven with `asyncio.gather` share no event id and neither sees the other's chunks), SSE framing against a real Postgres LISTEN channel (a strict `tests/sse.py` parser that accepts `id`/`data` frames and comment frames and nothing else), and a strict-msgpack round trip of every `CORE_CHECKPOINT_TYPES` entry plus the state type a spec declares - which the package could not prove alone before, because the only such suite lived in `apps/api`. **One real bug, found by the suite and fixed**: `_stream_answer` returned on the first event seen after the cancel was set, and pydantic-ai runs the agent in a background task that had already executed the tool and produced its `FunctionToolResultEvent`, so a stopped turn discarded a result it was holding and persisted the call in state `input-available` forever - a tool part that spins after a reload for a tool that finished. The rule is now *a cancelled turn ends before the next part the model starts*: the step already in flight reports its outcome, and the existing guarantee that no further model call is streamed is unchanged (`test_a_cancelled_turn_makes_no_further_model_call_and_finalizes` still passes beside the new `..._still_reports_the_tool_that_already_ran`). **One real gap, named not fixed**: the shipped turn graph resolves no deferred tool call, so `Tool(x, requires_approval=True)` on a one-agent assistant produces `tool-output-error` plus an `error` chunk reading "`DeferredToolRequests` is not among output types" instead of a `tool-approval-request` card, and `TurnState.pending_approval` is a channel no turn ever writes; PathFinder's Lead implements the cycle, `assistants/site_help` cannot - a backlog item with the fix and the chunk sequence it would produce (closed in WS-V batch P1). **`packages/assistant-core/PROTOCOL.md` is version 1.0.0** of the wire: frame grammar, cursor semantics (`after` is exclusive, cursors are per-deployment and not dense), the snapshot/tail contract and the `204` fallback, the `start ... finish done` turn shape, the three `finishReason` values and the rule that an `error` chunk does not end a turn, the full chunk vocabulary, the reduction rules, and the additive-only versioning rule. Its examples are captured from real turns and its tables are compared to `register_core_stream_parts` and to pydantic-ai's `vercel_ai.response_types`, so a new chunk kind or a changed payload fails `test_protocol_document.py`; only generated ids and instants are edited. Recorded as [the wire protocol is a written spec, verified against captured frames](decisions/the-wire-protocol-is-a-written-spec.md), which names the rejected alternatives: generating the page from the models (true by construction, and with nowhere to put a rule) and leaving it hand-written (silent drift). **Where the boundary cuts**: `run_turn`, the cancel watcher that polls `chat_turn_cancellations`, the durable-tool interrupt stream, the title generator, `identity_gate` and the user-message envelope all live in `apps/api`, so the suite composes their package-side equivalent in `drive_turn` (start chunk, `astream`, epilogue, finish, done) and says so; `turn_epilogue` is exercised, `identity_gate` is not reachable without a transport. `docs/knowledge/conventions/verification-gates.md` gained the package lane. Verified: from the package, `uv run pytest` 192 passed with `find_spec("pathfinder") is None`, ruff over `src tests`, ruff-format, mypy --strict 53 files; from `apps/api` - untouched this batch - ruff, ruff-format, mypy --strict 557 files, pyright 0/0/0, import-linter 7 kept 0 broken, 2392 unit and 379 integration tests, `python -m pathfinder.devtools.openapi check` exit 0; knowledge gate clean at 110 files. No file under `apps/web/` was touched.

* **WS-V batch 1: the runtime is a package, and the boundary is now an installation fact.** `packages/assistant-core` is its own distribution - own `pyproject.toml`, own `uv.lock`, `src/assistant_core` importable with no `pathfinder.` prefix, own `tests/` tree, own CI job - and `apps/api` consumes it as an editable path dependency beside `pathfinder-shared`. The eleven-module surface that batch D pinned as "what the runtime may reach outside itself" moved with it, because every entry was runtime-owned by nature: `platform/{config,context,db,logging,pydantic_base,types}.py`, `integrations/embeddings/{model,prefixes}.py` (now `assistant_core/embeddings/`), and the four tables the runtime reads and writes - `conversations`, `messages`, `conversation_events`, `memory_tombstones` - with `MessagesRepository`, `MessageMetadata`, the `GUID` type, the application-id column and the declarative `Base`. **Three modules split rather than moved, each along what it imports**: `config.py` became `RuntimeSettings` (database URL, engine echo, SSE keep-alive, log level and format) in the package with `Settings` subclassing it in the product and installing itself through `use_settings_source`, so one instance still serves the process and `get_settings.cache_clear()` still works in tests; `context.py` kept `veupathdb_auth_token_ctx` and `request_base_url_ctx` product-side and moved the six the runtime and its logger read; `db.py` moved the engine, the session factory and the request-scoped session, and left `init_db` - which runs alembic against `alembic.ini` - as `platform/migrations.py`. `errors.py` and `principal.py` stayed, because their taxonomies name WDK, VEuPathDB bearers and PathFinder service tokens; the one thing `db.py` took from `errors.py` was a sqlite guard, which now raises `ValueError` with the same detail (both reach the client as a 500). **One declarative base, not two metadatas.** A cross-package foreign key resolves only inside the `MetaData` that holds both tables, and the keys cross in both directions (`conversations.user_id` and `conversation_events.task_id` point at host tables; `conversation_strategies`, `background_tasks`, `chat_turn_cancellations` and the two scratchpad tables point back at `conversations`), so the package exports `Base` and the product maps its twelve tables on it. `alembic/env.py` is untouched, `target_metadata` still lists all sixteen tables, and every migration stays hand-written. The package's own test kit declares stub `users` and `background_tasks` tables so `create_all` works with nothing else installed. **The thread lost its relationship to the science**: `Conversation.strategy` and `Conversation.strategy_view` named `ConversationStrategy`, which a package class cannot, so `ConversationRepository.get_with_strategy` and the two listings now select the thread beside its projection through one outer join (one query where `selectinload` issued two), `get_strategy` reads the projection alone, `get_owned_thread_or_404` returns both, and `build_conversation_response`/`build_conversation_summary` take the projection as an argument; `build_conversation_summaries` states the list mapping once. `Conversation.user` was deleted, because a package class cannot name `User`; `User.conversations` stayed as a **one-directional** relationship, because the unit of work reads it to insert a user before the thread that references it, and dropping it turned 22 integration tests into `conversations_user_id_fkey` violations. `TurnContextFactory` became `Callable[[TurnContextRequest], Awaitable[TurnContext]]`, because PathFinder's factory read `strategy_view` off the row it was handed and now has to read its own projection. **Contract 7 was replaced, not deleted twice over**: the package's pyproject names no dependency on this application (the enforcement), `tests/unit/test_package_boundary.py` walks every module in the package and fails on an import naming `pathfinder` while pinning the two `shared_py` wire-type modules it does read (the belt), and the seventh in-repo contract now says *the science never imports an assistant's composition root* - direct-only, like the six layer contracts, because the chat dispatcher still reaches the registry through the job runner. `test_core_boundary.py` moved to composition level and reads the installed distributions instead of the import graph: the science requires the runtime, the runtime requires no part of the science, and the two source trees do not nest. Recorded as [the runtime is a package, so the boundary is an installation fact](decisions/the-runtime-is-a-package.md), which names the rejected alternatives: keeping the runtime in-repo behind contracts only, and leaving `conversations` product-side. Verified: `cd packages/assistant-core && uv run pytest` passes 128 tests with **no `pathfinder` installed** (the isolation proof, testcontainers Postgres, `importlib.util.find_spec("pathfinder") is None`), plus its own ruff and mypy --strict (53 files); from `apps/api`, import-linter 7 kept 0 broken, ruff, ruff-format, mypy --strict (557 files) and pyright zero findings, 2771 tests green in one run (2392 unit, 379 integration, 50 skipped, 98 subtests), `packages/spec/openapi.json` byte-identical, the file-size gate reporting the same five known files (it now scans the package too), and the knowledge gate clean at 108 files. No file under `apps/web/` was touched.

* **WS3 batch 2: a second assistant answers through the same runtime, and its diff contains no orchestration.** `pathfinder/assistants/site_help/` is 3 modules - a spec, one pydantic-ai agent with two read-only catalog tools (`list_veupathdb_sites` over `services.catalog.sites.list_sites`, `describe_site` over `get_record_types` plus `get_raw_searches` for the per-record-type search count), and a ScriptedModel script - registered beside PathFinder in the one registry. It declares `TurnState` with no domain field, a bare `TurnContext` with no strategy session and no research clients, no stream parts, no memory kinds, no checkpoint types, no turn epilogue and **no identity gate**, so a signed-in application user with no VEuPathDB login is served; PathFinder's 401 `WDK_LOGIN_REQUIRED` on the same route with the same body is re-asserted byte for byte in the same test file. A boundary test walks the pilot's modules and fails on a single import of `pathfinder.ai`, and pins the eleven modules it does reach. **Lifted into core to serve it, each because the single-agent path needed it and none of it names a product**: `cost_for_run` moved from `ai/cost.py` to `assistant_core/cost.py` (token-to-USD is the runtime's accounting, and the module imported only `genai_prices`); the chunk-emit primitive became `assistant_core/graph/emit.py`, which also collapsed the two identical copies `_lead_capture.py` and `sub_agent_stream.py` each carried; and the assistant-message write became `assistant_core/graph/turn_message.py`, which read no PathFinder field before the move and now guards its own `SQLAlchemyError` so both finalize paths inherit it. `ScriptedModel` scripts may return a `TextPart`, because an agent whose output is prose has no `final_result` tool to call. `assistant_core/graph/single_agent.py::single_agent_graph` compiles the reusable turn graph: it streams the agent's text and tool calls through the same `PhaseStreamEmitter` the Lead uses, accumulates `RunUsage` into `turn_total_tokens`/`turn_total_cost_usd`, stops on the turn's cancel event without a further model call, and ends in the runtime's finalize step. It compiles **two** nodes, not one: the message row is reduced from chunks the durable log only holds after the agent's step has ended, so a same-node finalize would race the writer. Quota persistence stays product-side - `services.quota` is forbidden to core by contract 7 - so the helper takes the charger as a declared hook and the pilot's turns count against the same monthly budget. The pinned core surface grew by exactly `persistence.repositories.message` and its `_message_metadata`. **Creation paths**: `POST /api/v1/conversations/{id}/begin` takes an optional `assistantId` with the chat route's semantics (new thread takes it, existing thread keeps its own, mismatch 409, unknown 404) and the seed-title generation now uses that assistant's mock rather than the default's; `devtools/chat.py` takes `--assistant`. Verified: import-linter 7 kept 0 broken, ruff, mypy strict (596 files) and pyright zero findings, 2489 unit and 388 integration tests, openapi drift additive only (`BeginConversationRequest.assistantId`), types regenerated, `tsc --noEmit` and 2177 vitest clean, file-size gate reports the same five known files.

* **WS3 batch 0/1: the assistant declares its own architecture, and the runtime routes to it.** `assistant_core/spec.py::AssistantSpec` is a frozen model with `assistant_id` and eight declarations - a graph factory (`checkpointer -> CompiledStateGraph`), an initial-state factory (`TurnStart -> TurnState`), a turn-context factory (`TurnContextRequest -> TurnContext`), a mock-model factory, `checkpoint_types`, a stream-part hook, `memory_kinds`, an identity gate and a turn epilogue - and each one replaces something the pipeline previously hard-coded about PathFinder: `build_pathfinder_graph` named by four processes, `_build_turn_input`'s dict, `_turn_helpers._build_runtime_context` with its two stub research clients, `title_generator`'s `get_mock_model` import, the import-time `register_checkpoint_types` call in `ai/graph/state.py`, `_stream_parts_schemas`'s direct `register_strategy_stream_parts`, `PRODUCT_MEMORY_KINDS`, the chat route's `require_registered_wdk_identity` dependency, and `turn_runner._emit_strategy_revision`. The spec module imports `persistence.models` and `platform.types` and nothing else outside core, pinned by an extension to the core-surface test; `pathfinder.assistants` joined contract 7's forbidden list, so the runtime cannot reach the composition root either. `pathfinder/assistants/` builds PathFinder's spec from the existing `ai/` pieces and `registry.py` is the one composition root that main, the worker, the durable-resume runner and devtools consume. **Routing**: `conversations.assistant_id` (`NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pathfinder'`, indexed, alembic `2026_08_22_0001`, both directions tested against a real database) is the record; an optional `assistantId` on the chat body is read only when the thread is created, an unknown id is 404 `ASSISTANT_NOT_FOUND` and naming another assistant on an existing thread is 409 `ASSISTANT_MISMATCH` rather than a silent substitution - a caller that believes it is talking to B and reads A's answers has no way to notice. The `ChatTurnPayload` carries the resolved id to the worker and `jobs/runner.py` reads it off the row on a durable resume; `dispatch` re-checks the row `begin_conversation` returned against what it resolved, so a concurrent first turn that created the thread under another assistant is refused rather than deferred under the wrong one. **Identity**: the chat route's gate is now `resolve_chat_assistant`, a dependency that resolves the assistant and runs `spec.identity_gate` when one is declared; PathFinder declares `require_registered_wdk_login`, so the refusal is the same 401 `WDK_LOGIN_REQUIRED` with the same title and detail, and `test_wdk_login_required.py` passes untouched. The route table gained a `SPEC_GATED` section with the reason and two cases that fail if the chat route ever carries both gates or stops resolving an assistant. The state factory returns a model and the runtime sends only `model_fields_set`, so an approval resume still leaves the checkpointed prompt alone. Recorded as [the orchestration belongs to the assistant, not to the platform](decisions/the-orchestration-is-the-assistants.md), which names the rejected alternative: one platform graph parameterized by config, rejected because a config-shaped Lead is still a Lead - a simpler app declares a different graph, not a defanged one. Verified: import-linter 7 kept 0 broken, ruff, ruff-format, mypy strict (594 files) and pyright zero findings, 2460 unit and 380 integration tests (98 subtests), openapi drift additive only (`ChatRequestBody.assistantId`, `ConversationResponse.assistantId`, two `ErrorCode` members; the chat request body `$ref` is byte-identical), types regenerated, `yarn tsc --noEmit` and 2177 vitest clean, knowledge gate clean.

* **WS2 batch D: the assistant runtime is a directory, and a contract keeps it one.** The last batch of the platform program (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-21-ws2-in-repo-seams.md`) moved the runtime-generic modules into `apps/api/src/pathfinder/assistant_core/` - 25 modules across `capabilities/`, `conversation/` (chunk reducer, AI SDK adapter, event writer and stream, checkpoint serde and saver, stream-part registry), `graph/` (`TurnState`, `TurnContext`/`AssistantDeps`, the pre-turn and agent-factory hook types, the runtime chunk builders), `memory/` and `models/scripted.py` - and 210 references in 106 files followed, with no alias and no re-export shim. Membership was decided by walking each candidate's transitive imports, not by its name: what reaches nothing of PathFinder's moved, and what does not stayed and is named below. Three files held both halves and split along the line batch A drew: `ai/graph/runtime.py` (`TurnContext`/`AssistantDeps` to core, `Context`/`AgentDeps`/`build_node_deps` product), `ai/graph/stream_events.py` (the chunk builders whose kinds the core registry registers to core; enrichment, strategy revision and ledger stay product), and `integrations/embeddings/semantic_index.py`, whose fastembed singleton was the runtime's only indirect route to a WDK type and is now `integrations/embeddings/model.py` - the cache key still hashes the same model-name string, so no stored `.npz` row was invalidated. `PreTurnHook` and `TurnAgentFactory` became PEP 695 generic aliases bound to `TurnState`, `TurnContext` and `Agent`, so core states the hook shape and `builder.py`, `lead_node.py` and `composition.py` name `PipelineState`, `Context` and `LeadAgent` at the call. **Contract 7** (`The assistant runtime never imports the science, directly or indirectly`) is the only one of the seven that also rejects indirect chains, because a runtime that reaches the science through one hop is not a runtime a second assistant can take; it was proved to bite by planting `from pathfinder.ai.graph.state import PipelineState` in `event_writer.py`, which it reported both as a direct violation and as a two-hop chain to `pathfinder.domain.strategy.staleness`. What stays reachable is the whole allowed surface and nothing else - `pathfinder.platform`, `pathfinder.persistence.models`, `pathfinder.integrations.embeddings` - pinned as an exact set by `tests/unit/assistant_core/test_core_boundary.py`, which caught its own batch when the `ReasoningEffort` de-duplication added `platform.types` to it. That de-duplication collapsed three identical `Literal["none", "low", "medium", "high"]` declarations (`graph/runtime.py`, `conversation/request_body.py`, `platform/types.py`) onto the platform one. Left product-side deliberately, with the blocking import named: `ai/graph/builder.py` names `make_lead_node` and `finalize_turn_node`, and injecting a graph's node set is a seam this batch did not design; `ai/conversation/dispatcher.py` defers `jobs.tasks.run_chat_turn_job` and opens the thread through `services.conversations.begin`; `turn_runner.py` and `_turn_helpers.py` reach `services.conversations.responses` and `graph.runtime.Context`; `request_body.py` publishes `PhaseRole`; `title_generator.py` calls `get_mock_model()`. Recorded as [the assistant runtime is a package boundary, not a contract over scattered modules](decisions/assistant-core-is-a-package-boundary.md), which names the rejected alternative: a contract over a module list with no move, which leaves the extraction an archaeology exercise over a 100-file tree. Verified: import-linter 7 kept 0 broken, ruff, ruff-format, mypy strict (587 files) and pyright zero findings, 2423 unit tests (33 of them the new boundary cases) and 369 integration tests with 98 subtests, `packages/spec/openapi.json` byte-identical, the knowledge gate clean at 105 files, and no file under `apps/web/` or `packages/` touched.

## 2026-08-21

* **WS2 batch C: the runtime hard-codes nothing of PathFinder's any more.** The seven pluggability entanglements (assessment Appendix A rows 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, 14) are inverted. **Roles**: `TurnContext.phase_models`/`phase_reasoning`, `resolve_phase_tier_config`, the agent registry and `PendingApproval.phase` all take a plain string; `PhaseRole` survives only in `ai/agents/roles.py` and the three models that publish it, and `SUB_AGENT_APPROVAL_PHASE` moved to `ai/lead/sub_agent_tools.py`. **Pre-turn**: the live WDK staleness read left the turn node for `ai/lead/pre_turn.py` and reaches the graph as a required `pre_turn` hook. **Agent**: `lead_agent` is no longer a module singleton - `build_lead_agent()` is a factory the builder takes, so each turn owns its instance and its `override`; the dead `isinstance(agent.model, FunctionModel)` branch went with it. **Guards**: `ToolRepetitionGuard` and `ToolResilience` take their tool-name sets and thresholds as constructor arguments, with PathFinder's in `ai/agents/tool_vocabulary.py`. **Instructions**: `_instructions.py` keeps the two generic pinned renderers (typed on `AssistantDeps`); the system prompt, FRAME workspace, graph, ledger and discovered-searches renderers moved to `strategy_instructions.py`, byte-identical (pinned by a render digest before the move, then retired for a per-agent order contract). **Memory**: the store, retriever, tombstone index and re-embed all key by `str`; `auto_write_memories` takes candidates and a user id, so `ai/memory/` imports no product module at all, and `ai/lead/memory_candidates.py` owns the four kinds and the turn-to-candidates mapping. **Mock**: the reusable half (role markers, sequence advance, `FunctionModel` wiring, context vars) is `ai/models/scripted.py`; `mock.py` is PathFinder's script for it, with all 71 mock unit tests unchanged. One `build_pathfinder_graph` composition root replaced five duplicate `build_graph` call sites. Three copies of "read the model id off an agent" collapsed into `ai/models/settings.baked_model_id`, and `ConversationUpdate` left the conversation repository for its own module so the file-size gate reports only the five known files again. Recorded as [the runtime takes the vocabulary as an argument; the wire keeps it](decisions/vocabulary-is-an-argument.md) and [the Lead agent belongs to the turn that runs it](decisions/the-agent-belongs-to-the-turn.md). Found on the way and filed rather than fixed: the repetition guard is registered on no agent, so the mechanism this batch made injectable never actually runs (closed in WS-V batch P1). Verified: ruff, mypy strict, pyright and ruff-format zero findings, import-linter 6/6, 2390 unit tests (67 of them new seam tests), the integration suite, and `packages/spec/openapi.json` byte-identical - the frozen wire contract is what kept the three published role enums and `MemoryValue.kind` narrow.

* **The embedding cache holds one row per entry, and the encode no longer runs on the event loop.** The whole-file cache validated a site by hashing its whole catalog, so any drift in the fetched content re-encoded everything: the same api process built the portal index twice in one boot at 2472 and then 2934 entries, tritrypdb (414) and vectorbase (923) re-encoded hours after another process had written their npz to the shared volume, and a worker chat turn on the portal held the worker at 785% CPU for 2 h 39 m while every queued turn and the heartbeat waited. The cache is now content-addressed per entry: `SearchIndexEntry.cache_key` is a sha256 over the model name, the document prefix and the enriched text, the npz carries `keys` beside `embeddings` with the rows aligned to them, and `build()` reads the file as a key-to-row map, encodes only the entries with no row, assembles the matrix in the canonical `(record_type, search_name)` order from cached and fresh rows, and writes back exactly the current keys, so stale rows leave the file instead of accumulating. A catalog that drifts by N searches costs N encodes, where the portal's second build of that boot paid for all 2934. Files in the old `embeddings + hash` shape, the bundled ones included, read as a miss and are not converted, so each site pays one more full encode and only deltas after that. Two invalidations are automatic: the model name is inside the key, so a model swap invalidates every row, and a cached row whose width does not match the model's output re-encodes the site. Writes are staged under a pid-suffixed name and renamed into place because api and worker share the `embeddings_cache` volume, and a truncated file now reads as a miss rather than raising. Off the loop: `build()` is `async` and the fastembed call runs through `asyncio.to_thread`, which ONNX makes real work rather than a formality since it drops the GIL for the encode; `SearchCatalog._build_semantic_index` is the only caller and both of its call sites were already coroutines, so the seam is three awaited lines and no service changed shape. The turn that triggers a cold build still waits for its own index, but nothing else on the worker does. Eight unit tests pin it, including a delta encode that receives only the new entry's text, a removed entry that keeps the others and drops its key from the file, the old-format and truncated misses, the width miss, and an event-loop responsiveness test whose fake blocks inside `embed` on a `threading.Event` and fails if the loop cannot release it. Verified: ruff, mypy strict and pyright clean, 2351 unit tests.

* **WS2 batch B: a conversation is a thread again, and its strategy is an attachment.** The second hard entanglement (`persistence/models.py`, assessment Appendix A row 4) is gone. Ten columns left `conversations` for a new `conversation_strategies` table whose primary key is also its `ON DELETE CASCADE` foreign key: `record_type`, `wdk_strategy_id` (with its unique partial index), `is_saved`, `step_count`, `strategy_ast`, `estimated_size`, `gene_set_id`, `gene_set_auto_imported`, `experiment_id` and `imported_saved_strategy_ids`. The thread keeps identity, name, dismissal, fork lineage and its timestamps. The child carries **no** owner column: scoping is the parent's `(user_id, application_id)` pair and `services/conversations/authz.py` did not move, so every query that reaches the side table drives from `conversations` and inherits its predicates. Absent means never built: a thread starts row-less, the first strategy write inserts, and readers take `Conversation.strategy_view`, a frozen `ConversationStrategyView` whose field defaults **are** the absent-row semantics, so no call site grew a `None` branch. The relationship is `lazy="raise"` with one explicit `selectinload` in the repository reads that need it (plus `populate_existing`, because the side row is written by Core statements that do not synchronize a loaded relationship - the `expire_all()` that `apply_operation` used to need is deleted and pinned by a test instead); the consumers listing does not load it, because its caller reads names. Two pieces of debt died on the way: `ConversationUpdate.strategy_ast_set` existed only to write SQL `NULL` into a `NOT NULL` column (SQLAlchemy's `none_as_null=False` turned it into a JSON `null`), replaced by `ConversationRepository.clear_strategy`, which updates in place so a never-built thread stays row-less and a cleared graph keeps its gene-set and experiment links; and alembic `2026_08_21_0002` normalizes those stored `null`s to `{}` while moving only the rows that actually hold strategy state. Both directions of the migration are tested against a real database. Verified: ruff/mypy/pyright zero findings, import-linter 6/6 kept, 2317 unit + 369 integration tests, `packages/spec/openapi.json` structurally unchanged (the HTTP contract does not move in this batch). Recorded as [a conversation is a thread; its strategy is an attachment](decisions/conversation-thread-and-strategy-split.md), which names the rejected shape: one table with nullable strategy columns, which would still hand a second assistant's threads two foreign keys into PathFinder's science tables.

* **WS2 batch A: the turn state and the wire vocabulary are seamed.** The first two seams of the platform program (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-21-ws2-in-repo-seams.md`) landed together. `PipelineState` is now `TurnState` (the generic turn: message, accounting, approvals, consults, memories) plus one `domain: StrategyDomainState` field holding the eight strategy fields; `Context`/`AgentDeps` split the same way into `TurnContext`/`AssistantDeps` plus product subclasses; the checkpoint serializer keeps a core allowlist and takes product registrations at import, and a guarded migration flushes old-shape checkpoints while sparing the checkpointer's own DDL ledger. The strict round-trip tests caught three REAL pre-existing decode bugs on the way: `ToolApprovalResponded`, `UserQuestionAnswer` and `StepPushFailure` reached checkpoints unregistered, so a strict decode returned plain dicts and attribute reads would have raised. Two dead fields died instead of crossing the seam (`AssistantDeps.writer`, `PendingApproval.plan_id`). On the wire side, the closed `data-*` union became a `StreamPartRegistry` (core parts in core, strategy parts registered by a product module, schema-only tier for payload models no kind emits), the TS `DataPartKind` opened to `KnownDataPartKind | (string & {})`, and the renderer map is a compile-time-total merge of a core half and a strategy half; part kinds keep their names ([decision](decisions/part-kinds-keep-their-names.md)) because a rename would invalidate persisted event replay. Verified on the combined tree: ruff/mypy/pyright zero findings, 2308 unit + 348 integration backend tests, 2177 vitest, boundaries clean, knowledge gate clean, and a live devtools turn against plasmodb through the new checkpoint shape (frame, build, verify, zero failures). Known couplings deliberately left for batch C: `PendingApproval.phase` still speaks `PhaseRole`, and `turn_state.py` imports `ai/agents/roles` for it.

* **The suite reached 120 passed / 10 failed / 0 flaky, and the feature project is fully green.** Every strategy-edit spec, both purge specs and the enrichment panels pass; the trajectory across the campaign is 94, 105, 120 of 133. The last GO-spec failures were their own lesson: the spec's follow-up question named the mock's GO marker phrase, which routed a plain question into a rebuild that re-minted every step id (the AST leaf changed from `step_65fae9c7` to `step_8b4f3fc6` across one turn) - the question now avoids marker phrases, the precondition reads the vocabulary half through `values`, and the file passes in 33 s. The ten that remain are deep in composite flows and are a healthier class of red: two cross-feature flows now live long enough to fail their axe checkpoint with serious/critical accessibility violations, five journeys share one `rail-strategy-panel` wait, and three are tail-of-run environment flakes; all filed with next steps in the e2e residual-failures backlog item, since closed. One operational lesson is recorded beside them: a worker chat turn on the portal built the portal's semantic index in-process for 2 h 39 m at 785% CPU, freezing every queued turn - the portal's catalog varies per fetch, so a whole-file cache cannot validate, which the per-entry cache entry of the same day closes.

* **The mock now speaks the FRAME contract: discovery before binding, and one half of a GO criterion.** The run-12 edit-family failures reproduced deterministically in the chat debugger: `set_criterion` is enum-guarded to the discovered search universe, the mock never called a discovery tool, and the guard's cold start admitted the first sheet read and then locked the universe to that one search - the second criterion was refused verbatim, `search_name='GenesByTaxon' is not a known value for set_criterion. Choose one of: GenesByText`, three identical replays, retry cap, "Response failed". Separately the GO arc died on the parameter rule `go_term and go_typeahead on GenesByGoTerm are ORed halves of one criterion ... Put the criterion in go_typeahead`, because the canned values filled both. `frame_call` now emits `list_searches` before any criterion so every canned name enters the universe, and `_go_kinases` carries `go_typeahead` only. Both arcs re-run clean end to end against live plasmodb in the debugger: the interpro turn ends on the feedback prose the specs wait for and the GO turn on the success digest, zero tool failures. Six new mock unit tests pin the sequence and the halves rule; the SSE golden is untouched because its prompt rides the echo arc.

* **A transient database ping can no longer latch the API unready forever.** Both health endpoints re-verify the database with a live ping and marked it failed on any exception - and nothing ever marked it ready again, so one blip during a CPU-saturated embedding sweep left `/health/ready` at 503 (with `error: ""`, because `str(TimeoutError())` is empty) while login, writes and enrichment all served correctly; the container reads unhealthy, `web` refuses to start behind it, and every page load sits at "Starting up...". The successful ping now marks the database ready again - the live ping is the authority in both directions - and a failure records `str(e) or type(e).__name__` so the state always names a cause. Three integration tests pin recovery on both endpoints and the non-empty label.

* **The embedding cache keys content, not fetch order, and lives in a volume.** `_catalog_hash` serialized entries in catalog iteration order, and that order differs between a live fetch and a disk-restored catalog, so an identical catalog re-embedded from scratch on most boots - measured as a 4.5-minute rebuild of a 3-hour-old amoebadb index, roughly 20-25 minutes per recreate for all sites, and hours when the portal missed. `build()` now sorts entries by `(record_type, search_name)` before hashing, which also guarantees the cached rows align to the entries by construction; two unit tests pin cache survival across a reordered catalog. The cache directory is a named `embeddings_cache` volume shared by api and worker, so one process's sweep warms the other and a recreate starts warm. The e2e overlay also pins `VEUPATHDB_SITES_CONFIG` to `e2e-sites.yaml` - the portal plus the five component sites the suite drives - so an e2e boot never embeds the seven catalogs no spec touches.

* **The enrichment cluster is explained: the call is legitimately slow, and the specs now say so.** A timed probe of `POST /api/v1/gene-sets/{id}/enrich` with all five types on live plasmodb answered 200 in 163 s with real terms (GO 17/20/20, word 4; pathway reported "Analysis unavailable" for the two-gene set, which is WDK's own verdict). The pipeline is bounded server-side - a 300 s analysis poll cap, capped retries, a process-wide batch semaphore - and the run-12 traces show the request simply outliving the specs' 120 s wait (status -1, neither result nor error), where before the proxyTimeout fix the 30 s rewrite cap answered with a bare 500 that the specs accepted as an outcome. The enrichment helper's ceiling is now 360 s and it extends only its own test's budget via `test.setTimeout`; `ChatPage.goto` tolerates a lagging readiness gate for 60 s. The purge specs were reconciled to the registered-account model in the same pass: the shared WDK account carries strategies the run did not create, so both specs now assert identity, not count - `:66` imports the account's strategies first and proves a dismissed projection is not resurrected, `:120` collects the run's own `wdkStrategyId`s and proves none survives on any site.

## 2026-08-20

* **The suite reached 105 passed / 23 failed / 2 flaky / 0 did-not-run, and the 23 have three measured causes.** The run-10 deletion, durable-SSE and auth clusters are green. Of what remains, (a) the strategy-EDIT family and the edit-ending journeys time out on `/returned 0|root size is 0|too narrow|loosen/i`, the OLD mock's verification-feedback wording, which the rewritten mock never emits - the one reconciled spec (`insert-saved:15`, via `expectVerificationFeedback()`) passes, the rest carry inline copies of the dead regex; (b) the purge specs fail against the polluted shared WDK account, named outright by the flaky `user-data:66`: "sync-wdk re-imported 50 active strategies on plasmodb after dismiss purge" - prior runs left hundreds of strategies under the registered test account, so "everything deleted" cannot hold; (c) the enrichment cluster (analysis, workbench panels, all three cross-feature specs, five site journeys) waits 120 s for a result OR an error and sees neither, which predates every change this week and is the one unexplained cause. All three, with the fix each needs, are in the e2e residual-failures backlog item, since closed.

* **The mock model is site-aware, and two more response-path bugs are fixed.** The deterministic mock (`ai/models/mock_specs.py`, `mock.py`) now derives the organism from the conversation's site (five sites), builds four spec shapes (single, GO, a 3-node InterPro chain, a 5-node combine), and routes prompts naming InterPro/PF00069/EC 2.7 through a feedback arc whose fix-prompt succeeds - which exposed a real harness bug: the frame stage counted tool calls instead of resolved parameters, so a `ModelRetry` read as success and produced an empty build. Specs stop hardcoding node ids through new AST fixtures (`e2e/fixtures/ast.ts`). On the product side, `DELETE /api/v1/conversations/{id}` and restore committed after the response like `/open` did (commit moved before it, three integration tests reading through a second session), and Next's rewrite proxy answered any API call over its 30 s default with a bare 500 - a long multi-site purge among them - so `next.config.ts` sets `experimental.proxyTimeout: 300_000`, recorded with the alternative it rejected in [the API rewrite carries a long call](decisions/the-api-rewrite-carries-a-long-call.md). The e2e cleanup client sent no CSRF header (every non-GET postcondition 403'd silently; header applied at all seven call sites), and `auth.spec.ts` inherited the worker's cookies through `browser.newContext()`, so its signed-out cases ran signed in - it now passes an explicitly empty storage state.

* **Two bugs only a fast client could see, found by running the e2e suite against the production web image, both fixed.** First: `POST /api/v1/conversations/open` returned the new conversation id before the row was committed, because the request-scoped session commits in yield-dependency teardown and FastAPI runs that after the response is sent; the dev-mode web client was slow enough to lose that race every time, and the production build's instant sidebar refresh won it - a trace shows open returning one id and the immediately refreshed listing (HTTP 200) holding only other ids. The route now commits before returning. In-process test transports buffer the whole app call including teardown, so no integration test can reproduce the race; the e2e suite is the regression test. Second: the app's on-load `POST /api/v1/veupathdb/auth/refresh` re-minted `pathfinder-auth` from the `Authorization` cookie even when a valid internal session existed, silently switching accounts - in e2e every worker collapsed onto the one registered VEuPathDB user while older cookie snapshots kept writing as per-worker users (two requests from one test carried different `pathfinder-auth` cookies). The endpoint now honors its own docstring: a request with a valid internal token keeps it (200, no Set-Cookie); absent or expired still mints, pinned by three unit tests. The e2e stack itself was corrected on the way: the web service runs the production image (the containerized dev server was OOM-killed twice and hydrated slower than Playwright clicks), and `docker-compose.e2e.yml` now points at `pathfinder_test` instead of the dev database, into which earlier runs had written several hundred conversations. Full-suite result after all fixes: 94 passed / 26 failed / 1 flaky in 1.3 h with every one of the 254 worker turns succeeding; the residual failures are recorded as four clusters in the e2e residual-failures backlog item, since closed.

## 2026-08-19

* **Every owned resource now belongs to a user under one application, and the same user reaching it from another application is refused exactly as a stranger is.** `application_id` (`NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pathfinder'`) joins `conversations`, `gene_sets`, `control_sets`, `experiments`, `memory_tombstones` and `monthly_usage`; the rest of the tables hang off a conversation and are scoped through it. The value comes from `application_id_ctx`, which the request resolver already set from `X-PathFinder-Service-Token` and which a worker job now sets from the conversation row - the only durable record of which application a turn belongs to - through `attach_conversation_application`, which raises rather than guessing when the row is gone. The check went **inside** the helpers that already decide ownership, so no route grew a parallel check: `owned_by_caller` in `services/conversations/authz.py` (used by the 403 helper, the 404 helper, revert, fork and WDK open), the repository list queries, `GeneSetStore.aget` and `ExperimentStore.aget` plus their cache merges (a process-local cache hit was the one path that could cross applications without touching the database), `ControlSetService` (a public control set is public to its own application, not to every application), and the durable-task queries, which now join the conversation. Memories moved with them: the namespace is `("app", <application>, "user", <user>, <kind>)` from one builder, and the alembic revision rewrites every existing `store` and `store_vectors` prefix to `app.pathfinder.user....` by copying under the new prefix before deleting the old, because `store_vectors` references `store(prefix, key)` with no `ON UPDATE` action; the rewrite is guarded by `to_regclass`, since the store tables are created by the memory lifespan and not by alembic. Quota splits attribution from the cap: `accumulate` writes the calling application's row on a `(user, application, period)` unique key, `get_current` sums every application of the user, so `GET /api/v1/me/quota` keeps its shape and a second assistant cannot double a budget. **Twenty-nine tests pin it**: the authorization matrix gained a third client - the same user, a different application - which found **21 mutating routes** serving another application's request (chat opened an SSE stream, PATCH and fork answered 200, delete answered 204, the memory PATCH and DELETE answered 200 and 204) and now finds none; six HTTP cases on the read half (conversation, gene set, experiment, control set and memory listings, and a single-resource read whose refusal must equal the refusal a stranger gets, not a status of its own); one on the purge; three on memory isolation including a tombstone; three on quota; two on the worker reading the application from the row; and six on the migration, run against real databases - a seeded old-namespace memory moves with its expiry and its vector and comes back on downgrade, the column is `NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pathfinder'` on all six tables, the four new indexes and two unique keys exist, and a database that has never opened the store upgrades without error. The two worker-boundary unit suites now also assert the job runs as the conversation's application. `DELETE /api/v1/user/data` follows the same rule: it dismisses or deletes only the calling application's conversations, gene sets, experiments and control sets, and evicts only that application's entries from the gene-set cache, because a caller that cannot read a resource must not be able to destroy it; an erase-everything action that names no application does not exist yet. Its `deleteWdk=true` arm was deleting **every** strategy in the user's VEuPathDB account for the site - website work included - because it purged what `list_strategies()` returned; it now deletes the ids the already-scoped conversations carry in `wdk_strategy_id`, intersected with what WDK still holds, and leaves a saved strategy a chat only imported alone, since nothing records whether the user made it here or on the website. Recorded as [a resource is owned by a user under one application](decisions/application-id-tenancy.md), which names the rejected shapes: one user row per application (it splits the VEuPathDB identity that `users.external_id` holds, so one researcher becomes several users with several WDK guest tokens and no single budget) and one database per application (a pool, a migration run and a backup per assistant, with no shared quota). Left per user on purpose: `exports`, a short-lived download artifact fetched by a UUID its owner was just handed, which nothing lists.

* **A VEuPathDB bearer token now authenticates, a service token names the calling application, and a bearer request is exempt from the cookie-CSRF header.** Every request resolves to one `Principal` (`platform/principal.py`: `user_id`, `application_id`, `credential`) through one function (`platform/security.py::_identify`), in a fixed order: an `Authorization: Bearer` value that verifies as a PathFinder HS256 JWT is `pathfinder-bearer`, the same header otherwise is read as a VEuPathDB token, the `pathfinder-auth` cookie is `pathfinder-cookie`, and nothing else is 401. `CurrentUser` still hands routes a UUID, derived from the principal, so no route changed. The VEuPathDB path is validated locally, not by asking WDK: the signing key is `GET <VEUPATHDB_OAUTH_URL>/jwks` (default `https://auth.veupathdb.org`), the first entry whose `kty` is `EC`, cached in-process for 120 seconds, and the token is an **ES512** JWT on **P-521** - the same protocol `OAuthClient.getValidatedEcdsaSignedToken` implements for every VEuPathDB container service. Issuer and audience are deliberately unchecked, matching the reference client, whose `validateClaims` is an empty TODO: a site mints tokens for its own client id, so an `aud` check would refuse every browser-session token. A live registered-user token proves two facts the design turns on - its header is `{"alg":"ES512"}` with **no `kid`**, so a key lookup by key id finds nothing, and its payload carries `sub`, `is_guest`, `iss`, `aud`, `azp`, `iat`, `auth_time`, `exp`, `jti`, `preferred_username`, `signature` and **no `email`**. Because `users.external_id` is the email, the bearer path still maps through the resolver the refresh route uses (WDK `GET /users/current`), so bearer and cookie land on one row rather than two; the mapping is remembered per token hash for five minutes. A guest token is 401 on the bearer path, since a guest is a new identity per request and owns nothing durable. A JWKS that cannot be read - unreachable, non-200, or carrying no EC key - is **503** naming the identity provider rather than 401, because the credential was never examined; a token that fails against a key we did hold stays 401. Application identity is the optional `X-PathFinder-Service-Token` header matched in constant time against `PATHFINDER_SERVICE_TOKENS` (`app_id:secret[,...]`, secrets at least 32 characters, parsed at settings load, absent from every repr); an unknown token is 401, an absent one leaves `pathfinder`, and the id also rides a request ContextVar for the tenancy work. `X-Requested-With` is now required of cookie requests only, because a browser never attaches an `Authorization` header by itself. OpenAPI declares all three schemes (`APIKeyCookie`, `HTTPBearer`, `APIKeyHeader`), which fell out of using FastAPI's own security classes rather than patching the schema. **Fifty-two tests pin it**: nine on the validator against a locally generated P-521 pair (expired, wrong key, HS256, missing `sub`, a JWKS with no EC key, an unreachable server, and one fetch for many tokens), twenty-one on the principal, the service-token registry and the resolver (credential order, repeated application id, short secret, missing separator, secret absent from the repr, both ContextVars published), six on the CSRF rule, six on the settings, and ten HTTP integration cases (a bearer GET with no cookie and no CSRF header, a bearer POST that creates a conversation, a cookie POST that is still 403, a guest token, an unknown service token, a PathFinder bearer that never touches the OAuth server, and one WDK lookup across two requests). Recorded as [a VEuPathDB bearer token is the user; a service token is the application](decisions/bearer-identity-and-service-tokens.md), which names the rejected `proxied-user-id`: it is honoured only beside an admin token, and PathFinder acts on WDK **as** the user, so it needs the user's own token rather than permission to name them.

* **Done and removed: a queued or silent turn now keeps its SSE stream open and says "Queued".** `iter_sse` (`ai/conversation/event_stream.py`) wraps its pull from the LISTEN tail in a pending task, so a timeout emits `: keep-alive\n\n` and the tail keeps its asyncpg connection: one comment frame per `SSE_KEEPALIVE_SECONDS` (new setting, default 15, `ge=1`) of silence, on `POST /api/v1/chat` and on the resume stream `GET /api/v1/conversations/{id}/events` alike. A comment frame carries no `id:` and no `data:`, so the durable log, the cursor the client stores at `[DONE]`, and the AI SDK's parser see nothing: `eventsource-parser` 3.0.6 returns from `parseLine` on a leading `:` and only calls `onComment`, which `DurableChatTransport` does not pass, and its `dispatchEvent` fires only when the data buffer is non-empty. Before this the response wrote nothing at all until the worker's first chunk, and a tab that waited behind another turn of the same conversation showed "Response failed - Failed to fetch" while the turn ran to completion server-side. The wait itself is now named: `dispatcher.dispatch` persists `data-turn-status {label: "Queued"}` through the same writer as the user message, before `defer_async`, so the chunk can never land after the worker's `start`; the running message reads "Queued" until `run_turn` writes `start` and `Preparing context`, which is its first pair of chunks, so no second "Running" status exists. The queued chunk carries the turn id the job runs under, so a stop pressed while the turn is still queued reaches the turn the worker polls. Deliberately not added: a queue position, which needs a procrastinate query per request. Pinned by five unit cases on the frame and the setting, two integration cases (the queued chunk is the only row after the user message while the job waits, and the finished turn replays it in the snapshot), three vitest cases on the transport (comments dropped, an all-comment stream survives, a malformed data frame still kills the stream), seven on the placeholder label, and the SSE golden fixture, which gains exactly one chunk at its head. A keep-alive also holds open a stream that nothing will ever finish, so `jobs/maintenance.py::release_stalled_jobs` reads the `ChatTurnPayload` of each stalled `chat_turn:run` job and writes `error` + `finish` + `done` through `ChatEventWriter` before it fails the job, while the conversation lock still blocks a successor turn, and only when the newest chat chunk is not already `done` so a turn that ended is never reopened. A stalled `durable:*` job is released and not closed, so a tool resume whose worker died still leaves its stream open. Pinned by two integration cases and by `cancel_active_turn`, which now has one of its own showing a stop while queued reaching the worker's turn id and not the user message id.

* **Done and removed: every workbench experiment stream POSTed without the header the CSRF middleware demands.** `lib/sse/typedEventStream.ts` hand-built its own request headers, so the five stream callers - Evaluate, Batch and Benchmark in `features/workbench/api/streaming.ts`, the seed stream in `lib/api/experiments.ts` and the threshold sweep in `lib/api/analysis.ts` - sent `accept` and `content-type` and nothing else, and `POST /api/v1/experiments` answered `403 {"detail":"Missing required X-Requested-With header"}` while the browser showed "stream failed: 403". The helper now builds every header through `getAuthHeaders` in `lib/api/http.ts`, the builder the rest of the app already used, so `X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest` rides on every stream request; the per-caller copy in `useTaskEventStream.ts` is gone, and with it the `headers` option no caller passes any more. A refused stream now names the API's own `detail` beside the status instead of the bare number. Six vitest cases pin it: the helper on a POST and on a GET, the thrown message on a 403, and the three workbench generators driven through the real helper against a stubbed fetch.

* **A tool the user refuses now reads "Denied" on its sub-agent step card, not "failed".** `SubAgentStepPayload.state` carries `denied` beside `started`, `completed` and `failed`; `ai/lead/sub_agent_stream.py` emits it for a `ToolReturnPart` whose outcome is `denied` and keeps `failed` for a retry prompt or a returned error directive; the card maps it to the AI SDK's `output-denied` state, which the shared tool header already labels "Denied" and which shows the denial message as the result rather than as an error. A refused `delete_step` was indistinguishable from a WDK 404 in the UI and in telemetry before this.

* **The live WDK suites act as a registered VEuPathDB user now, or they skip under their own names.** VEuPathDB serves the WDK service to registered users only, so a cookie-less live suite proves nothing. One session fixture (`tests/conftest.py::wdk_registered_token`, over `tests/_support/wdk_credentials.py`) logs in once with `WDK_TEST_EMAIL`/`WDK_TEST_PASSWORD` through the same `password_login` the login route calls, and `require_wdk_creds` hands that token to a test or skips it with "live WDK now requires a registered user; set WDK_TEST_EMAIL/WDK_TEST_PASSWORD"; five copies of the login helper and six copies of the credential gate are gone with it. The strategy suites put the token on `veupathdb_auth_token_ctx`, which is where the discovery tests move too, because they were calling WDK with no credential at all. In the authz matrix the five owner cases WDK answers - experiment enrich, re-evaluate and results/record, gene-set enrich and results/record - are one parametrized case each and send the token as `X-VEUPATHDB-AUTH`, the header the request resolver reads; without credentials each of the five skips under its own route name, and the non-owner and cross-application refusals still run, because they are refused before anything reaches WDK. With the credentials the matrix is 17 passed; without them, 12 passed and 5 skipped.

* **Done and removed: a caller that supplied every visible required value was refused for a hidden one it could not see.** `validate_parameters` reads WDK's verdict before the local checks, and WDK judges the parameter shape the contextual metadata read hands it, so a hidden parameter missing from that read comes back as "Cannot be empty.". `context_for_metadata_read` was supplying only the hidden parameters that **allow** empty; it now supplies every unset hidden parameter that publishes an `initialDisplayValue`. Measured on live plasmodb.org, `transcript/GenesByText` with the three visible required values set (`text_expression=kinase`, `text_fields=[product]`, `text_search_organism=[Plasmodium falciparum 3D7]`) answered `text_fields: At least one parameter that 'text_fields' depends on is invalid or missing. Errors: { document_type => Cannot be empty. }; document_type: Cannot be empty.` and now returns canonical values including `document_type = "gene"`, disclosed in `substituted` because the caller never stated it. The run path is unchanged: `fill_hidden_required_defaults` still decides what a hidden required parameter is worth when the search is executed, and this is the metadata read. `profile_pattern` travels in that read too, at the published `hsap=1T`, which is exactly the request already measured at 200 when both structural maps accompany it. Pinned by the three unit cases in `test_search_params_under_context.py` that the old rule owned, rewritten to the new one, and by the live pipeline test that named the contradiction. Found by running the live parameter suites with the registered token for the first time; 45 pass, 0 fail.

* **Done and removed: every WDK-backed feature now requires a registered VEuPathDB login, and PathFinder mints no guest identity at all.** VEuPathDB refuses unregistered programmatic access: measured on 2026-08-19 against plasmodb.org and toxodb.org, `GET /record-types/transcript/searches/GenesByTaxon` answers `401 "Valid API Key required for this endpoint."` with no cookie and `403 "This endpoint is only available to registered users, and requires an API key."` with a freshly minted guest cookie, `POST /users/current/steps` answers 403 the same way, and a registered token answers 200; a browser `User-Agent` and `Referer` change nothing. The refusal is one code: `ErrorCode.WDK_LOGIN_REQUIRED`, 401 problem+json, title "VEuPathDB login required", detail "Sign in to VEuPathDB to use searches, strategies and gene sets.", which the web app keys on. The gate is one route dependency, `transport/http/deps.py::require_registered_wdk_identity`, which verifies the request's token locally against the OAuth server's cached ES512 key rather than decoding claims unverified, so a forged, expired or guest token is the same refusal on the cookie path as on the bearer path, and an unreadable JWKS stays 503 naming the identity provider. It is on the 31 routes that reach a WDK account and on no others: `POST /api/v1/chat`, the seven conversation subroutes that act on WDK (step-counts, operations, open, sync-wdk, save-substrategy, insert-saved, fork), the eval pair, the seven gene-set routes that materialize or read a WDK dataset, and the fourteen experiment routes that run, refine, read or delete a WDK strategy. A listing that reads local rows is not gated, so a user with no VEuPathDB session can still list and delete their own gene sets, read and annotate their own experiments, purge their own data, and keep every conversation, note, memory and setting. `tests/unit/transport/test_wdk_gate_route_table.py` names every gated route and carries the reason for each ungated route that can still reach WDK, so a route cannot change category quietly. Guest minting is deleted rather than disabled: `mint_guest_token`, `extract_any_auth_cookie`, `ensure_wdk_identity`, the `users.wdk_guest_token` column (alembic `2026_08_19_0002`, upgrade and downgrade both pinned against a real database) and its repository setter are gone, with the autouse test fixture that kept minting inert. The service account is confined by the transport, not by convention: `_http.py::_effective_token` refuses any `/users/` path when `veupathdb_auth_token_ctx` is empty, before the request leaves the process. `/users/current` is included: it resolves which WDK account the caller is, and without a token the answer is the service account or a fresh guest. `fetch_wdk_user` returns None without a request token, so `GET /api/v1/veupathdb/auth/status` can no longer report the application's own account as the signed-in user, and `DELETE /api/v1/user/data?deleteWdk=true` skips the WDK half and reports `wdkStrategies: 0` instead of refusing the whole purge. The suites take `WDK_TEST_TOKEN` in preference to `WDK_TEST_EMAIL`/`WDK_TEST_PASSWORD`, and a suite about what a route does past the gate says so through one fixture (`signed_in_to_veupathdb`) rather than carrying a token it does not need. **Twenty-five new tests pin it**: six on the service (no token, guest token, unverifiable token, registered token returned, an unreadable key that stays 503, and no request token reading no WDK user), five on the transport guard (a step read and a step create refused with nothing on the wire, the user's own token served, a search listing served as the application, `/users/current` served), seven HTTP cases against a real ES512 key and a stubbed JWKS (chat, a gene-set route, an experiment route and a strategy operation refused with the exact code, title and detail; a guest token and a forged token refused; a registered token reaching the handler's own 404), two on the migration, one that a signed-out purge still deletes the local rows, one that the `Authorization` cookie is read like the header, and three that pin the route table. Recorded as [a WDK-backed feature requires a registered VEuPathDB login](decisions/wdk-requires-registered-login.md), which names the rejected shape: one shared guest or service identity for anonymous users, which would land every user's strategies in one VEuPathDB account where each could read, edit and delete the others' work, and where the researcher would never find the work again under their own login.

* **The web app asks for a VEuPathDB login before any WDK-backed action, and never runs as a silent guest.** One recogniser reads the refusal the API now sends ([a WDK-backed feature requires a registered VEuPathDB login](decisions/wdk-requires-registered-login.md)): `wdkLoginRequiredDetail` in `lib/api/errors.ts` parses a 401 whose problem+json carries `code: "WDK_LOGIN_REQUIRED"` and returns the server's own detail, from an `APIError` (every JSON path, including the Kubb client) and from the plain `Error` the AI SDK's `HttpChatTransport` throws with the response body as its message. `state/useAuthGateStore.ts` owns the prompt: `handleWdkLoginRequired` reports the detail through `toast.error` under one fixed toast id, so a burst of refused queries replaces one toast instead of stacking, and opens the sign-in modal with that same text; it is the one routing call in the query-cache handler, in the composer's `beginStrategy` catch and in `useChat`'s `onError`, so no refusal is retried silently and none is swallowed. The query client used to drop every 401 without a word; it now forwards this one, with the error itself on the notice so the app layer can route it. The composer is the standing gate: `useVeupathdbSignedIn` is true only when the auth status says so, and while it is false the input and Send are disabled, the placeholder and an inline `VeupathdbSignInRequired` banner read "Sign in to VEuPathDB to build strategies", and its Sign in button opens the modal. `?embedded=true` no longer skips the check - `requiresFullScreenSignIn` blocks only a standalone session with the forced modal, and an embedded one renders so the composer carries the prompt in place, which is also why the modal is now reachable in embedded mode and closable when the user opened it. Both shells hold one prompt and one handler: `app/components/VeupathdbSignInGate.tsx` registers the query error handler and renders either the forced modal or the requested one, and the conversation layout and the workbench layout each render it, so a refusal on a gene-set or experiment query opens the prompt on whichever shell the user is standing in. It replaced two copies that had drifted: the conversation layout's second `LoginModal` was dead (its `open` could only be false after the early return), and the workbench layout drove its modal from `signedIn` alone and registered no handler at all, so a refusal there was silent. No UI copy or affordance promised guest use, so none was removed. The Playwright suite acts as the registered account: the per-worker storage state adds `WDK_TEST_TOKEN` as the `Authorization` cookie the API forwards to WDK, the postcondition client in `e2e/fixtures/api-client.ts` takes the browser's whole storage state rather than copying one cookie name (it was dropping that token, which would have 401'd every postcondition call on a WDK-backed route), PathFinder identity stays per worker through `/dev/login?user_id=worker-{N}`, `wdkTestToken()` fails loudly and never prints the value, and the unreferenced `e2e/fixtures/auth.setup.ts` is gone. Pinned by 41 vitest cases over nine files (the recogniser on both error shapes, the store and its routing including a real 401 problem+json driven through `requestJson` and the shared toast id, the query-cache forward against the still-silent 401, the shared gate opening on a refused query and staying shut on an unrelated one, `useChat`'s `onError` driven by a stubbed chat POST, the composer disabled and prompted when signed out and clean when signed in, and the embedded-versus-standalone gate) and three Playwright cases in `e2e/feature/auth.spec.ts`.

* **A non-finite enrichment value is `None`, never 0.0, and the wire says how many pasted genes the statistic used.** WDK returns `"Infinity"` for an odds ratio (and can for a fold enrichment) when the term's genes are all inside the set, and the old `SafeFiniteFloat` clamped every non-finite ratio and probability to 0.0: the strongest hits sorted last and a non-computable FDR read as maximally significant. `EnrichmentTerm` ratios and probabilities are now `float | None` through one annotated type (`platform/pydantic_base.py::NonFiniteToNone`), the ranking rule lives in `services/enrichment/ranking.py` (a `None` ratio sorts first descending, a `None` probability sorts last ascending and is never significant), CSV/TSV write `Inf` for an unbounded ratio and an empty cell for a probability, JSON writes `null`, the HTML report cannot raise, and the analysis table, dot plot and custom-enrichment section render `Inf` / `n/a` from the regenerated nullable types. `custom.py` reports `geneSetInBackground` beside the pasted `geneSetSize`, and its own odds ratio is `None` when a 2x2 cell is zero instead of a clamped finite number (`3600.0`, `180.0`, `880.0` were reported where the truth is unbounded). The authz matrix now covers experiment, gene-set, control-set and memory routes beside conversations (41 cases, five resource kinds), asserts the owner is not refused (401/403/404 or a hang) with a fresh owned resource per case, classifies ids one level into nested bodies including `list[Model] | None`, and proved it can see holes by three injected faults; it found none.

## 2026-08-17

* **Done and removed: an approval-required tool inside a sub-agent now reaches the user, and the answer re-enters that sub-agent.** `optimize_search_parameters`, `delete_step` and `clear_strategy` carry `requires_approval=True`, but a sub-agent run is not streamed through the VercelAI adapter, so its `DeferredToolRequests` output was dropped by an `isinstance` filter: `verify_strategy` raised `TypeError` and `recover_failed_steps` returned an empty `RecoveryDelta` while the real state was "waiting on the user". The suspended run is now kept. The inner call is announced to the client as its own tool part - `tool-input-start`, `tool-input-available` with the real arguments, and `tool-approval-request` whose approval id IS the inner tool call id - so the generic Approve/Deny card renders it with no frontend change; the Lead's dispatch call is deferred with `CallDeferred`, and the whole turn checkpoints on `PendingApproval.sub_agent`, which carries the sub-agent's role, its approvals and its message history. The next turn replays that history with `DeferredToolResults(approvals={...})`, closes the inner part with `tool-output-available` or `tool-output-denied`, and hands the finished delta to the Lead as `DeferredToolResults(calls={dispatch_call_id: delta})` - the value the wrapper would have returned. A second approval defers the turn again instead of running the Lead. Each dispatch is one function (`run_frame`, `run_recovery`, `run_verification`) shared by the direct call and the re-entry, so the spec sync, the build re-sync and the verification digest cannot drift between the two paths, and sub-agent usage is recorded once per half under the dispatch's call id. **Nine tests pin it**, all against the real verification and execution toolsets with scripted models: the three chunks and their ids and arguments, `PendingApproval(phase="verification", sub_agent=...)` with the Lead's dispatch call suppressed, an approval that runs the inner tool exactly once, a denial that finishes the sub-agent with the tool never invoked, a second approval that re-defers, the frame dispatch resumed from its stored arguments, and a strict-msgpack round trip of the nested approval - `PendingApproval` itself was never on the checkpoint allowlist and is now, with the two new models. `sub_agent_tools.py` was 415 meaningful lines against a 400-line gate before this work; the streaming engine moved to `ai/lead/sub_agent_stream.py` and the two spec messages to `ai/lead/dispatch_messages.py`, so every file it touches is under the cap. The turn after a deferral always resolves the dispatch call, because pydantic-ai re-executes a deferred call it is given no result for and the execution role would re-apply its edits: a typed reply resolves the card (approved when the text is nothing but an approval phrase by the injection scanner's own whitelist, otherwise denied with the text delivered to the Lead as the next message), a turn that resolves nothing keeps the card and runs no sub-agent, and two dispatches deferred in one response raise `ConcurrentSubAgentApprovalsError` naming both rather than silently re-running the second. Recorded as [a sub-agent's approval is answered inside that sub-agent](decisions/sub-agent-approvals-re-enter-the-sub-agent.md), which names the two rejected shapes: re-asking through the Lead's `consult_user` (loses the tool's identity and arguments, and re-decides the call instead of resuming it) and dropping `requires_approval` from the sub-agent tools (a ~15 minute sweep and two destructive edits would run unasked).

* **Backlog reshaped by the "stop the bleeding" batch, and one new item that a scripted run proved.** The worker-serialisation item lost its concurrency half: `jobs/worker.py` now runs `WORKER_CONCURRENCY` jobs (default 4; procrastinate 3.8.1 has one global setting, not per-queue), chat-turn and durable-tool jobs are deferred with `lock=<conversation_id>` so only one conversation's jobs serialise, and a `maintenance:release_stalled_jobs` sweep fails any job left in `doing` past `WORKER_STALLED_JOB_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (default 3600, measured from the job's started event and not the heartbeat, because a starved loop can self-prune a live worker's row) so a killed worker cannot wedge a conversation behind its lock. What remains of that item is the SSE "queued" heartbeat. The heartbeat-starvation item now states that concurrent turns starve the loop more, not less. New, and closed the same day by the entry above: an approval-required tool inside a sub-agent never reaches the user - a scripted `FunctionModel` run shows `optimize_search_parameters` in the verification sub-agent ends in `TypeError`, `delete_step` in the execution sub-agent ends in an empty `RecoveryDelta` with no error, and only the Lead's `consult_user` yields a `tool-approval-request` chunk; the frontend now renders generic Approve/Deny controls for any `approval-requested` tool part, so the fix is entirely on the sub-agent streaming path. Also closed outside the bundle, recorded here so the ledger is complete: `POST /api/v1/chat` and `/api/v1/eval/strategy-gene-ids` now refuse a non-owner (404, hidden existence) with an authz matrix over every conversation-scoped mutating route; the PIGuard pure-approval short-circuit is unconditional (its detection keyed on a chunk nothing emits); `phase_models` is validated against the model catalog; agent telemetry content export is opt-in; custom-enrichment p-values use the exact hypergeometric tail (n=5000, k=200, m=50, x=15 was 2.08e-21 by normal approximation, exact 4.17e-10) and the significance count reads FDR. The wider assessment that ordered this batch is `docs/assessment/2026-08-17-veupathdb-assistant-platform-assessment.md`.

* **Done and removed: the unit tier could reach the network, so an inert stub passed against a live server.** An autouse fixture in `tests/unit/conftest.py` now patches `socket.socket.connect`, `connect_ex`, `socket.getaddrinfo` and the event loop's `create_connection` and `getaddrinfo` for the duration of every unit test, so the tier refuses every connection made through Python's socket module, and a refusal names the test, the target and the two ways out. It derives from `BaseException` rather than `Exception`, which is the difference between a guard and a suggestion: the research clients retry under `except Exception`, and a refusal they could swallow would restore the hazard. No dependency was added - `pytest-socket` is not in the project, and the guard is one fixture and five patched call sites in a file that already exists. The block is total rather than remote-only, because a rule with an exception nobody can see is not a rule. Running the suite under it exposed **zero** inert stubs, which is the honest result and not a null one: the class was found once, fixed once, and is now closed by construction rather than by inspection. What it did expose is that **two files in the unit tier were integration tests** - `test_wdk_identity.py` and `test_saved_strategy_consumers.py`, ten tests that read and write the database - and they have moved to `tests/integration/`, so no production test carries the opt-in marker at all. **2,058 unit tests pass with every socket refused**, ten of them covering the guard, including that `except Exception` cannot swallow it and that `AF_UNIX` is not the network. Two limits are recorded rather than papered over: collection-time downloads happen before the fixture runs, and a C extension holding its own socket is not covered. The [verification-gates convention](conventions/verification-gates.md) carries both, plus `ruff format --check src/`, which does not overlap `ruff check` and was silently drifting on eight files.

* **Four deferred minors from the parameter-resolution and phyletic-contract ledgers, closed.** A `profile_pattern` that states one species code twice was taking the "not a census pattern" wording, which sends the reader to look for a malformed token that is not there; `_read_census` now returns the repeated code beside the states, and the 422 names it and quotes the two ways to state it once. Both paths to the wire raise it: the expansion path and `_normalize_parameters`, which reaches WDK without expanding. The unreadable-tree fallback in the same function re-parsed the pattern it had already parsed, and now encodes the states in hand. [WDK-PARAM-008](wdk/rules/parameters-and-vocabularies.md) anchored at `domain/parameters/values.py:to_wire`, which is not where the substitution comparison lives; it now anchors at `services/catalog/wdk_substitution.py:substituted_params`, and the enforcing test is unchanged. The `_word_weights` docstring in `param_sheet.py` claimed a rare word "must outweigh any number of common words", which the arithmetic does not do: a word `n` labels hold is worth `1/n`, so a unique word is worth 1.0 and three words of weight 0.5 beat it. The comment now states that bound. Left alone and recorded here rather than half-done: `_vocab_signature` in `param_dag.py` is recomputed per call, and memoizing it is not the two-line change it looks like, because `ParameterInfo` is a mutable Pydantic model that is neither hashable nor safe to key by identity, and the dominant cost is `vocabulary()` itself, which three of the same call sites invoke directly.

* **The half of a criterion nobody wrote into is now switched off rather than asked about, and the half that widens the search is refused.** A `radio-params` pair is two required parameters one query ORs, so the intuition that filling both narrows the search is exactly backwards ([WDK-SITE-007](wdk/rules/site-model-params.md)). `set_criterion` reads the pair off the search definition - the same cached read the phyletic derivation uses, so it costs no extra GET - and binds `N/A` into the free-text half of every declared pair. A criterion written into the free text comes back as a retry that names the pair, says the vocabulary half cannot be switched off and quotes its default, lists the vocabulary entries nearest to the value with the wildcards stripped, and sends a wildcard to `get_parameter_options(query=...)` to be expanded into the entries it covers. The off value is reported in `defaulted_params`, so the user is told about a value the request never stated. Measured on plasmodb.org for *P. falciparum* 3D7: `ec_number_pattern=2.7.-.-` beside `ec_wildcard=N/A` returns **364**, and so does the published default `2.7.11.1` beside `2.7.*`, because that wildcard happens to cover the default; `2.7.11.1` beside `N/A` returns **136**, and beside `*protease*` returns **141** - the 133 protein kinases of the default carried into a search asking only for proteases. Two live behaviours this replaces: a turn that bound `ec_wildcard=2.7.*` next to a default it did not choose, and a turn that left it null and got an open slot, because the walk refuses to inherit a free-text default. The FRAME procedure states the same rule, the resolver bench arm records a refused free-text half and continues so the guard is measured, and the rule is `ENFORCED`, which empties the `SILENT` column for the third time: **32 of 83 untested, all of them HARD or CONTRACT.**

* **The search whose criterion nobody could state now states it once.** `GenesByOrthologPattern` carries one criterion - which species must have an ortholog and which must not - in three parameters: two visible free-text lists the query never reads, and a hidden required SQL `LIKE` pattern that is the only one it does read. The model could propose the lists and could not touch the pattern, so the pattern came from `initialDisplayValue`, which is `hsap=1T`, a well-formed expression in a different parameter's grammar on a different site. **The two lists are now the proposal, the pattern is derived from them, and all three are written together.** The sheet gives both lists the clade tree as their vocabulary, so the model names species and clades by code or by label; `derive_phyletic_overrides` resolves them against that tree, pushes each clade down to the species the census holds, sorts the tokens into census order, and returns the pattern beside the two canonical lists for `set_criterion` to bind. An unknown term is a retry naming the nearest labels, a code in both lists is a conflict, and two empty lists are a retry rather than a binding - the bare `%` matches every census, so it reads as a phyletic answer and is not one. Live on plasmodb.org for *P. falciparum* 3D7: the derived `%hsap:N%pfal:Y%` returns **3,347** genes, `%pfal:Y%` returns 5,389, and the published default returns **0**. On the 20 gold strategies, 332 parameters, the propose arm moves from 285 exact / 18 wrong to **288 exact (stated 226, defaulted 62) / 15 wrong**, questions and unset values unchanged at 20 and 9, with the pattern and both lists exact on both gold steps of that search; the one wrong value left there is the organism strain, which is a model choice. One live turn bound the same three values after a single retry that named the nearest labels. Deleted with the work: `_build_phyletic_tree`, `_expand_entries`, the quantifier tokens and `is_census_pattern` from the wire layer, which now reads a value through `_read_census` and refuses a code that states two states; `integrations/veupathdb/phyletic_tree.py:phyletic_tree_of` is the one tree builder and the sheet, the binding and the wire guard all use it. [WDK-SITE-005](wdk/rules/site-model-params.md) and `WDK-SITE-006` are `ENFORCED` by backend tests, so the untested count is **33 of 83** and the `SILENT` column is unchanged at one. Recorded as [the two lists are the proposal](decisions/phyletic-lists-are-the-proposal.md). The hidden-required-defaults item keeps only its unmeasured tail: whether the hidden defaults on the other 181 searches return rows.

* **Two findings that work produced on the way, both kept.** First, "display purposes only" is a statement about the query and not about the metadata read: the contextual `POST` for that search answers **500** when the context carries `organism` and `profile_pattern` and omits the two structural maps, and either map alone is still a 500, while both together are a 200 with `validation: {level: SEMANTIC, isValid: true}`. Every hidden parameter that allows empty now goes into a metadata read's context at its published default, by shape rather than by name, at all three read sites. Second, that fix could not land until substitution detection was corrected. When the contextual read fails, the client falls back to the static `GET`, whose echoed values are the published defaults, so every value the caller set differs from the echo and none of those differences is WDK substituting anything ([WDK-PARAM-008](wdk/rules/parameters-and-vocabularies.md)). The comparison is now against the canonical values actually sent, a vocabulary echo is compared as a set, a hidden parameter this read supplies is never reported, and `values_were_read` gates both the comparison and the validation verdict when the read fell back.

* **Fixed: `PF00069` was not `PF00069 : Pkinase`, and the retry pointed away from it.** A typeahead vocabulary writes its terms as `<accession> : <label>`, and a proposal of the accession alone was refused as off-vocabulary. The nearest-entry list that came back was ranked by character similarity, so it offered `PF00569 : ZZ` and `PF00169 : PH` and not the one entry the accession identifies; two retries later the model changed `domain_database` to `INTERPRO` and bound `IPR000023 : Phosphofructokinase_dom`, which is the wrong science. Three changes, together: `match_exact_option` accepts a proposal that is the leading accession of exactly one entry, and refuses it when two entries share it; the nearest entries lead with the ones the proposal starts, so `PF0006` answers `PF00069 : Pkinase`; and the sheet pins an entry whose accession appears in the request as a word, not only one whose whole term appears. A shared accession is refused by naming the entries that share it, so the ambiguity is recoverable in the same turn rather than reading as an absent value. An accession holds a digit and is at least four characters, so a leading word such as `Plasmodium` is a label and matches nothing. [The decision](decisions/unmatched-accession-stops-the-chain.md) is amended again.

* **Done and removed: parameter resolution had three proposers and no contract.** There is one now, and it is the model. `set_criterion` with no `params` returns a parameter sheet - every visible parameter with its type, help, default, bounds, dependency and vocabulary - beside a `params_template`, the object to copy and fill, and the next call takes a value or an explicit null for each of them. A second sheet for the same criterion carries the parameters without the vocabularies, which the model already holds. The walk validates and binds: unknown names and off-vocabulary values are did-you-mean retries, numbers and JSON-encoded lists are coerced, a null binds the disclosed default or opens a slot, a dependent whose vocabulary changes under the bound parents comes back to be decided once, and a numeric parameter left null while the criterion states a quantity comes back unread rather than defaulting in silence. Measured on the same 20 gold strategies, 332 parameters: **exact 285 (stated 222, defaulted 63), wrong 18, asked 20, unset 9**, against a floor of **154 exact (all of them defaults), wrong 48, asked 115, unset 15** for the walk with no proposer at all. The four arms recorded before this work - 168/48/101 as the recorded baseline, 184/58/75 for production with the resolvers discarded, 205/62/56 with the resolvers allowed to bind, and the experiment harness at 255/54/14 and 276/27/20 - were measured before a held-back numeric default counted as a question and before the scorer compared wire values by kind, so they are history and not a column beside the new floor. Deleted with the work: both resolver agents and `ai/agents/vocab_resolver.py`, `ValueResolvers`, `bind_inferred`, `Provenance.INFERRED`, `map_intent_to_value` and every rule in it that read English, `narrow_candidates` and `vocab_narrowing.py`, the dead `resolve_search_parameters` and `get_parameter_dependencies` tools with the `DagResolution` half of the walk, and `organism_scope`, `direction` and `param_overrides` from the tool surface. The sheet does **not** embed, which is the one place the design changed under measurement: embedding a 5,461-entry vocabulary takes 238 seconds in the api container, so a shortlist is by word overlap with the goal, with anything the request names verbatim pinned. Recorded as [one proposer, one validator](decisions/one-proposer-one-validator.md); [the 2026-08-10 resolver decision](decisions/the-model-reads-the-request-not-a-cosine-score.md) is amended rather than deleted, because embeddings still may not decide a value - and its evidence section had claimed a profileset "binds correctly" that never bound, which is now struck. [An unmatched accession](decisions/unmatched-accession-stops-the-chain.md) and [a value the request already states](decisions/a-value-in-the-request-is-not-a-question.md) keep their principles and lost their rules; both now name what carries them. The live DeRisi prompt then built end to end, 16 steps, with zero invented parameter names, on the fourth run - the sheet arriving from `set_criterion` itself and the repeat losing its vocabularies are the two changes between that run and the third.

* **Also from the measurement: a search can offer the same criterion twice, and both halves are ORed.** [WDK-SITE-007](wdk/rules/site-model-params.md). ApiCommonModel declares the pairs in a `radio-params` property list - `go_typeahead`/`go_term`, `domain_typeahead`/`domain_accession`, `ec_number_pattern`/`ec_wildcard`, `metabolic_pathway_id_with_genes`/`pathway_wildcard` - and the property is published on the wire. The intuition a form gives is that filling both narrows the search; the query unions them. Measured on plasmodb.org for *P. falciparum* 3D7: `GO:0004672` alone returns 105 genes and the same pick beside the wildcard `*kinase*` returns **192**; `PF00069 : Pkinase` alone returns 81 and beside `*kinase*` returns **144**. Both halves are `allowEmptyValue: false`, and two of the published defaults are refused by the search that published them, so there is no off position - only a value that matches nothing. The worst case is `GenesByEcNumber`, whose typeahead half cannot be empty and whose published default is a real EC number: a search asking only for proteases carries 133 protein kinases and nothing in the response says so. The rule says which half is authoritative; the guard that enforces it is the entry above.

## 2026-08-16

* **The resolver bench was scoring the wrong input, and the design turned out to be sensitive to exactly that.** Every gold strategy carries `prompts.precise` - the request a user would type - and the bench loaded it but never used it, because it took the step's listing label whenever there was one. So the whole recorded baseline described resolution on a short phrase rather than on the shape production hands it. Feeding the request instead moves wrong values from **48 to 68** and makes the heuristics assert that the request stated **23** values it never stated about that parameter. More of the user's own words makes them more confident and less correct. First cut taken from that: an identifier in the text was written into every vocabulary-less param of a search, because only a *sibling's vocabulary* counted as a rival home - one `GO:0016301` landed in both a free-text query and a document-type selector, each claiming the request said so. It now binds only where one param can hold it, the rule the numeric slots already follow. **Wrong 68 to 58, exact 173 to 183, no new questions**, and the label baseline is unchanged.

* **Fixed: the published `profile_pattern` default reached the query unexamined.** The census guard returned early unless the value was wrapped in `%`, and WDK's own `initialDisplayValue` for `GenesByOrthologPattern` is `hsap=1T` - unwrapped, and an expression from OrthoMCL's grammar. So the one value most likely to be wrong was the one value nothing checked, and it returns an empty answer with HTTP 200. A pattern that is not built from census tokens is now a 422 naming the two tokens that work.

* **Fixed: a spec could be `ready_to_build` and still not convert.** Readiness reports that every criterion is bound and a structure exists; it does not run the conversion. A nine-criterion turn passed it, then died on `ValueError` after FRAME had spent the expensive part of the turn. The conversion failure is now a retry that names the structure, so the turn survives and the Lead can fix it.

* **A value the search chose is now visible as one.** `defaulted_params` was recorded per criterion and shown to the framing agent, but never reached the Ledger or the browser, so the only account of an assumed value was whatever the reply chose to narrate. The Ledger's criterion card now marks those params as assumed.

## 2026-08-15

* **Fixed: leaving a conversation and returning lost it.** Two independent defects, both found in the browser and both fixed with tests. (1) The transcript query was cached with `gcTime: Infinity`, so the list a mount read was the list every later mount got. A conversation created in this tab reads its transcript before the first turn exists, gets a 404, and caches the resulting empty list forever - so returning from the workbench, or from another chat, showed an empty conversation and only a page reload recovered it. The transcript is now re-read per mount. (2) A running turn was never re-attached, because `resume` was derived from `allowMissing`, which compares the URL id to a UUID the tab generated. Every conversation starts from a locally generated id, so that comparison stays true for the life of the tab and the chat kept treating a real conversation as an uncreated draft: no resume request was issued at all, the composer showed Send while the turn ran, and a reload appeared to fix it only because it minted a new UUID. Resumability is now its own flag - the URL names a conversation - and it is captured at mount, so the draft-to-URL rewrite cannot open a second stream over the live one.

* **Fixed: a durable task finished and the answer never appeared.** A turn that defers to a durable tool ends its own response at the interrupt, by design. The worker then runs the task, resumes the graph, and writes the rest of the turn to the event log - but nothing told the page that was still open to read it, so the user was left with a progress bar at 100% and no conclusion. The whole final message existed in the database the entire time and appeared only after navigating away and back. Three things had to hold at once, and finding the third took two failed attempts that are worth recording. (1) A trigger: the task's own progress stream now announces when the task settles, and the card re-attaches the chat. (2) The announcement cannot depend on the terminal chunk alone - a stream opened while the task ran can end without one, while a stream opened after it finished always gets it on connect, which is why the reload path looked healthy and the live path did not. It now announces when the stream ends, whatever the reason. (3) The re-attach then failed silently, because the event log stores the user's own message so a snapshot can rebuild the transcript, and that row is not an AI SDK chunk. The transport calls `controller.error` on anything its schema rejects, so the replay died on its first row, before the assistant's first token. The transport now drops that row rather than failing on it. The same `controller.error` path explains a `reading 'state'` TypeError seen earlier.

* **Fixed: two Lead tools turned a wrong argument into a dead turn.** Asking for control tests on a combined step made the Lead pass `Combine` - the label the strategy view renders for a combine node - as a variant's `search_name`. WDK rejected it once the run reached the server, so the turn spent itself and reported no metric and no way forward. Both variant tools now refuse a combine step before running anything and name `run_control_tests_on_step`, which takes a step id, instead. Separately, `import_control_ids_from_strategy` and `compare_variants_scored` parsed their id arguments with `UUID()`, so a WDK strategy id - which the conversation shows everywhere - raised `ValueError` and ended the turn with `badly formed hexadecimal UUID string` in the user's face. Both now answer with a retry that names the value they got and the kind of id they want.

* **Fixed: an invalid phyletic state emptied a strategy in silence.** A plain ToxoDB request for kinases with no ortholog in *C. parvum* framed correctly and then wrote `%cpar:0%` into `profile_pattern`. The census tokens are `code:Y` and `code:N`; `:0` matches nothing, WDK answers 200 with a count rather than an error, the ortholog step returned 0 and the whole intersection collapsed to 0. Opening that step in the editor read "0 included, 0 excluded, 864 unconstrained", which is the same symptom the widget used to produce before its encoder was corrected - so the grammar was fixed on the widget side and not on the agent side. The code half of each entry was already validated against the site's vocabulary, and `cpar` is real, so nothing objected. The state half is now validated too and an entry that states neither presence nor absence is a 422 naming the entry and the two tokens that work. This is the hazard `WDK-SITE` was written for, reached from an ordinary prompt rather than from a hand-made pattern.

* **Fixed, both halves: an edit made outside the flow that produced an artefact never reached the artefact.** A parameter changed in the graph editor moved a step from 3,259 to 897 and the root from 15 to 3. Two things then disagreed with reality, and they needed opposite fixes, which is the part worth carrying: **WDK owns the strategy**, so anything stored here is either stamped with when it was true or re-read from the server. (1) The Ledger's Build tab kept showing 3,259 and 15 marked `ok`, and the Lead quoted 15 as current while asserting nothing had changed. The Ledger is a record of what the build did, so it stays frozen and now says its counts are from the build. The reason its staleness check never fired is that `detect_build_staleness` compared the recorded counts against `live_step_counts`, which read the same persisted AST the build wrote - **a cache compared with itself, unable to detect any edit by construction**. The live side now reads WDK, and `live_step_counts` is gone. (2) A gene set went the other way: it stores its member ids and rendered its results by re-reading the step it came from, so the panel showed "15 genes" beside a table of 3, and an enrichment saved against it stopped describing its own input. Membership is what the set stores, so results are now reported from a step materialized from those ids. WDK refuses to run a step belonging to no strategy, so the materialized step is held by an internal one, cached by the membership hash.

* **Verified in the browser, not reproduced: the two open agent items.** A request stating "top 10 percent" bound `min_expression_percentile` to 90 against a declared default of 80, selected the trophozoite sample window, and asked no questions under an explicit use-defaults instruction. Both numeric intent and use-defaults are held open pending their original repro, since this search carries two numeric slots and so does not exercise the single-slot rule that was added for them.

## 2026-08-14

* **A hidden parameter was choosing the science, and the bundle covered none of it. Added `WDK-SITE`, a rule family whose falsifier is ApiCommonModel rather than WDK.** `GenesByOrthologPattern.profile_pattern` is hidden, required, 4000 characters of free text, and it is a **SQL `LIKE` pattern** matched against a colon-joined species census - `%code:Y%` for present, `%code:N%` for absent, `%` being the wildcard rather than a separator. Nothing upstream states that grammar in prose; it was reconstructed from [the query's own SQL](wdk/rules/site-model-params.md) and confirmed by measurement on plasmodb.org and toxodb.org. Four things follow and none of them is a refusal: a wrong pattern is not refused, tokens out of ascending code order match nothing (`%atum:Y%bant:Y%` returns 387 and the reverse returns 0, on three separate pairs chosen because tree order and code order disagree), a clade code matches nothing, and **WDK's own published default returns nothing** - `initialDisplayValue` is `hsap=1T`, which is a valid expression in OrthoMCL's *different* `phyletic_expression` grammar (it returns 9691 groups there) and is meaningless here. Six `WDK-SITE` rules plus [two `WDK-PARAM` rules](wdk/rules/parameters-and-vocabularies.md) for the general lesson: `initialDisplayValue` is whatever the spec holds, the model default behind it is stored by [a setter whose javadoc promises validation and whose body does not](wdk/rules/parameters-and-vocabularies.md), and `isVisible: false` is presentation only - a grep of the whole WDK repository finds `Param.isVisible()` read in exactly two places, one of which just publishes it. The new explainer is [site-model parameters](wdk/model/site-model-parameters.md); `scripts/check-wdk-rules.mjs` learned the `SITE` namespace and its suite went from 27 tests to 28. ApiCommonModel had been pinned since the bundle was created with a note admitting nothing cited it; that note is now deleted rather than softened.

* **Filed two defects the research found, both PathFinder's rather than WDK's.** The phyletic profile widget writes a pattern that matches nothing is ranked first in the WDK section because the trigger is an ordinary user action: pick species in the step editor, submit a valid form, get zero genes and no error. `encodeProfilePattern` emits `code>=1T` / `code=0T` - OrthoMCL syntax, measured at 0 on both sites - and three separate faults have to be fixed together, since the token grammar, the ordering and the clade-versus-leaf expansion each independently yield zero. Its own test file asserts `pfal>=1T` literally in three places, so **the test pins the defect and has to be rewritten rather than patched around**; `decodeProfilePattern` cannot read the correct form either, so a step built by PathFinder's own backend opens in the editor reading "0 included, 0 excluded". Second, filling a hidden required parameter from `initialDisplayValue` chooses the science: the fill is the right shape - WDK demands these parameters and the model cannot supply them - and the value it fills carries no guarantee at any layer. The same belief is written into `param_dag.py:_is_free_text_query` as a comment, and both have to move together.

* **Review caught the worst of it, and it made the finding worse rather than smaller.** The query is a `UNION`, and its **first** branch never touches `LIKE`: it inspects the pattern *string* with `not like '%:Y%'` and, when the string carries no `:Y`, returns every ortholog-less protein-coding gene for the selected organism. So "a wrong pattern returns zero" was the wrong statement of the hazard. **A wrong pattern returns whatever that branch yields for that organism**, which is zero here and is guaranteed nowhere - and a plausible non-zero count from a meaningless pattern is the worst answer this product can give. Four of the measured forms carry no `:Y` (`hsap=1T`, `hsap>=1T`, `hsap=0T`, prose) and their zeros are a property of the data; the two `:Y`-bearing zeros (`%zzzz:Y%`, `%MAMM:Y%`) are intrinsic. **Every string PathFinder's widget can emit lacks `:Y`**, so it never reaches the matching branch at all. I isolated that branch with `hsap=1T` on **eleven organisms across both sites** and it was empty on all eleven - recorded as a limit of the measurement, not as a refutation. A residue argument that had been offered as reassurance was deleted rather than repaired: it was vacuous, since both patterns it compared lack `:Y` and so both include the same branch. Also from review: `WDK-SITE-001`, `-002`, `-004` and `-005` are **live-only** - `profile_string` is built outside all four pinned repositories - so each now says so in the rule itself, and [sources.md](wdk/sources.md) gained the mirror image of its source-only ledger, with a re-run instruction per rule. A rule with no upstream and no re-run is unfalsifiable, which the charter forbids. Vocabulary counts were re-derived with `jq`: 865 terms, 818 lowercase, 47 uppercase, no duplicates, every term four characters except the three-character root `ALL` - so `three_letter_abbrev` is wrong about its own contents for 864 of 865 rows.

* Recounted the rule bundle honestly afterwards. **81 rules, 45 UNENFORCED**, and the number that matters is that the `SILENT` untested column went from **0 to 5**: four of the new site rules and the `initialDisplayValue` rule. The backlog item that claimed the `SILENT` class was closed no longer claims it.

## 2026-08-10

* **Read what WDK already answers, and stop reporting numbers it did not give.** Five changes, all from the pinned rule set rather than from a failing run. (1) One named count: the two count paths returned different quantities, because `estimatedSize` tracks `displayTotalCount` while the fallback read `totalCount`, and only the view pair matches the records returned. (2) The four counts became optional, so an absent count can no longer read as a scientific zero; the response schema and generated types were made honest rather than kept convenient. (3) A negative `estimatedSize` now reads as no count instead of surfacing as a gene count. (4) The validation bundle returned by the search endpoint is read instead of discarded, honouring the rule that a false verdict at level `NONE` means nobody checked. (5) WDK reports which values it substituted, so provenance is now corrected by the server that already knew it. Writing the first rule test also found a live contradiction: the model was told to send the synthetic tree root as a select-all shortcut, and the canonicalizer rejects it, as WDK does. Also closed: the delayed-result sentinel is recognised by shape and retried.

* **Added `docs/knowledge/wdk/`, a falsifiable WDK reference, and a gate that fails when its evidence stops resolving.** Four groups - [rules](wdk/rules/), [model](wdk/model/), [rest](wdk/rest/) and [pathfinder](wdk/pathfinder/) - carrying **73 assertions** about WDK, each with a GitHub link pinned to a 40-character sha and an anchor naming the PathFinder symbol it governs. Most are confirmed live on plasmodb.org and toxodb.org rather than reasoned about; six are source-only and [sources.md](wdk/sources.md) lists them by name. The new gate `scripts/check-wdk-rules.mjs` (pre-commit and CI, with its own fixture suite) fails on an unpinned citation, a moved anchor, a named test that no longer exists, and prose citing a withdrawn rule. Every `ENFORCED` and `PARTIAL` status was then audited against one standard - would the named test go red if the rule were broken - which downgraded three: [WDK-VOCAB-002](wdk/rules/parameters-and-vocabularies.md), whose test drove the canonicalizer while its anchor is a second, untested expansion in `integrations/`, and [WDK-STRAT-002 and WDK-STRAT-003](wdk/rules/strategies-and-steps.md), whose hypothesis trees came out of `flatten_tree` and so satisfied single-rootedness and reachability by construction. The honest tally is **8 ENFORCED, 9 PARTIAL, 56 UNENFORCED**, and the number that matters is that **19 `SILENT` rules have no test** - the class where WDK answers 200 and the science is wrong. Filed as one item, 56 of the 73 WDK rules have no test, which ranks the conversion `SILENT` first and carries the open questions the research left behind, including a `JSESSIONID` belief that did not reproduce on three live probes.

* **Root-caused the recurring crash, correctly this time, and fixed the seam behind three earlier bugs.** Pushed back on: the same issues kept returning, which was right. Two findings. (1) `No tool invocation found for tool call ID` is thrown by the Vercel AI SDK **client**, not OpenAI, when a `tool-output-error` names a call the client never saw announced -- it never reaches a backend log, which is why it read as a silent provider rejection. [no-openai-item-ids](decisions/no-openai-item-ids.md) misattributed it and now carries a correction; the real one is [chunk suppression follows the call, not a list of chunk types](decisions/suppression-follows-the-call-not-the-chunk-type.md), since fixed and verified in the browser. (2) "Get a search's parameters under a context" had **no owner**: six call sites, four exception types caught, five recoveries, two with no handling at all -- and the two with none are exactly where B16, the default-vocabulary read, and the abandoned criterion landed. One owner now: [a contextualized param view is an enrichment](decisions/contextualizing-params-is-an-enrichment.md). Verified against the live 500: WDK fails, we log once and return all 6 params.

* **The multi-criterion mega prompt, in the browser, on a real account.** No crash, on either the Portal or PlasmoDB -- the turn that used to die on `No tool invocation found for tool call ID` now completes. On PlasmoDB, FRAME operationalized all five criteria (four kinase routes as a UNION, the non-syntenic orthology transform, the trophozoite mass-spec-or-microarray alternative, Broad 3K variation, and phyletic specificity) for $0.03. It then declined to build, because one criterion's search 5xx'd -- correct behaviour, wrong conclusion: the value WDK 500s on the refresh endpoint runs fine (a non-empty result). That 5xx has since been root-caused and fixed at the seam behind it -- see [a contextualized param view is an enrichment](decisions/contextualizing-params-is-an-enrichment.md). Two claims the same run made on the Portal were checked and are Portal artifacts: `GenesBySnps` genuinely does not exist there, while `GenesByOrthologs` does and retrieval simply missed it among 2,356 searches.

* **Done and removed: the dependent-param false rejection.** Two independent defects, both proven on live WDK. The tool was reading a dependent vocabulary under WDK's DEFAULT parents, so the model saw HB3's time points for a criterion bound to 3D7 and correctly reported hours that do not exist in what it was shown ([decision](decisions/a-dependent-vocabulary-is-read-under-its-parents.md)). Separately, a multi-pick answer was serialized to wire form at the tool boundary, so the whole array counted as one option and the model was told its own correct answer was invalid ([decision](decisions/an-override-list-stays-a-list.md)). Same prompt, before and after: 4 `set_criterion` failures to **0**, and the built strategy built (a large result protein-coding, intersected with a large result top-percentile trophozoite and 81 `PF00069` kinases, giving the intended genes). Filed from that run: a numeric bound stated in the request is ignored, then reported as honoured.

* **Fixed: an unmatched accession stops the chain.** "InterPro domain PF00069" bound `IPR000023 : Phosphofructokinase_dom` and returned almost nothing with verification reporting success, because the accession is Pfam and the dependent vocabulary was IPR-only. Live re-run now binds `PF00069 : Pkinase` and the intended genes. See [decisions/unmatched-accession-stops-the-chain.md](decisions/unmatched-accession-stops-the-chain.md).

* **Fixed: numeric defaults were being discarded.** WDK types numeric bounds as `string`, so the free-text guard (which exists to stop `GenesByText` inheriting `*reductase`) swallowed their declared defaults and asked five needless questions on `GenesBySnps`. That criterion now resolves with zero open slots. See [decisions/numeric-default-is-not-an-example.md](decisions/numeric-default-is-not-an-example.md).

* **Fixed: a parent term is a selection.** The organism tree matched only leaves, so a step scoped to "Plasmodium falciparum" (a node with 20 children on live WDK) rendered as "0 of 62 selected", and edits filtered the raw value so unchecking a leaf did nothing. See [decisions/parent-term-is-a-selection.md](decisions/parent-term-is-a-selection.md).

* **Fixed: the strategy structure is a tree.** `set_structure` left-folded a flat list, so `(B UNION C)` on the secondary input was inexpressible; the Lead correctly refused to flatten it. The nested form recovered a gene the flat form lost (3 vs 2). See [decisions/structure-is-a-tree.md](decisions/structure-is-a-tree.md).

* **Root-caused and fixed the tool-call-id crash.** Not orphaned tool pairs (`pair_tool_calls` logged zero corrections); it was `openai_send_reasoning_ids`, which defaults to True for reasoning models and echoes provider item IDs back from a history we rewrite. See [decisions/no-openai-item-ids.md](decisions/no-openai-item-ids.md).

* Real-account browser testing on a multi-criterion reference strategy. Fixed [build_strategy's unactionable retry](decisions/build-retry-must-be-actionable.md). Filed three findings: the tool-call-id crash on complex turns (since root-caused and fixed, see above), FRAME ignoring an explicit defaults instruction, and the organism param rendering as unset (since fixed, see above).

## 2026-08-09

* Done and removed: **FRAME turn cost**. The 40K bar was arithmetically impossible, but investigating it found a real defect: elision made agents re-fetch data they already had (a large share of tool calls in one turn). Fixed by keeping a digest. See [decisions/elision-caused-refetching.md](decisions/elision-caused-refetching.md). **Backlog is empty.**

* Done and removed: **FRAME to BUILD to VERIFY migration**. The flip was already complete in code; what remained was prose describing the deleted architecture to the model, and verification. Proven end to end on live WDK ( 590/598 transcripts, verification passed). Two decisions recorded: [prompts-match-the-architecture](decisions/prompts-match-the-architecture.md) and [strict state + flushed checkpoints](decisions/no-checkpoint-truncation.md) (reversed once the compat shim was pointed out). The live run also exposed a real cost gap, since investigated and fixed: [elision-caused-refetching](decisions/elision-caused-refetching.md).

* Removed as stale: **experiment controls and scoring (Phase 2b)**. Already built, wired, and tested. The real gap was discoverability: the unscored comparison tool never named its scored counterpart, and nothing guarded that either stays registered. See [decisions/capability-must-be-reachable.md](decisions/capability-must-be-reachable.md).

* Done and removed: **test fixtures should not cast to their type**. 32 casts removed, 10 lying fixtures fixed (including one using a raw string where the API returns a typed `ParamValue`), shared factories added. See [decisions/fixtures-are-built-not-cast.md](decisions/fixtures-are-built-not-cast.md).

* Done and removed: **devtool reports handled issues as anomalies**. The `silent_*` detectors now read the reply, and `RunCapture` no longer discards it. See [decisions/silent-anomaly-must-read-the-reply.md](decisions/silent-anomaly-must-read-the-reply.md).

* Closed as won't-do: **restore faker and msw generation**. Reproduced at 586 type errors, traced to a hardcoded `Partial<T>` override shape no plugin option controls, and concluded the output conflicts with the real-data testing rule. See [decisions/no-faker-or-msw-generation.md](decisions/no-faker-or-msw-generation.md). Replaced by the narrower fixtures-should-not-cast item, which is what the drift was actually about and which is now done: [decisions/fixtures-are-built-not-cast.md](decisions/fixtures-are-built-not-cast.md).

* Removed as stale: **JSONValue name collision**. `JSONValue` had already been deleted; the three remaining names (`JSONObject`, `JSONArray`, pydantic's `JsonValue`) do not collide even case-insensitively, no post-generation casing patch exists, and generation is byte-identical across consecutive runs. Investigating it did surface a live break, recorded in [decisions/one-way-to-generate-types.md](decisions/one-way-to-generate-types.md).

* Done and removed: **step creation takes spec objects**. `create_step` and `create_transform_step` already took `NewStepSpec`; only `create_combined_step` was the outlier, which is why it carried a `PLR0913` noqa. It now takes `CombinedStepSpec` and the noqa is gone. Added [decisions/boolean-operator-is-a-type.md](decisions/boolean-operator-is-a-type.md).

- Bundle created. Seeded from the R1-R6 graph rewrite session: the backlog that survived it, and the five decisions taken during it that are not recoverable from the code.

* **The DeRisi empty-branch item was retired by measurement rather than by a fix.**
  Its three candidate causes were tested live on plasmodb.org against
  `GenesByMicroarraypfal3D7_..._Percentile`, holding everything else constant:
  `any_or_all=any` at the top 10 percent over the fourteen trophozoite hours
  returns **871**, `all` returns **233**, and the looser top-20-percent forms
  return 1741 and 486. None is zero, so neither the any/all binding, nor the
  percentile tightening, nor the sample count empties the branch. The two ways
  to bind it wrongly both fail **loudly**: a sample set read under one
  profileset and sent under another is a 422 naming the terms that do not exist
  there (`23 Hour`, `29 Hour` are 3D7-only), and a branch term instead of leaves
  is the `countOnlyLeaves` 422. The step in the strategy that prompted the item
  reads **942**, not 0. The zero in that conversation was the phyletic-profile
  step, which is [WDK-SITE-002](wdk/rules/site-model-params.md) and understood.
  What survives is smaller and already filed elsewhere: that step bound
  `profileset_generic` to WDK's default `DeRisi HB3 Smoothed` rather than the
  3D7 set the request named.

* **Seven backlog items closed in one pass, and three of them by measurement
  rather than by code.** The orphan-delete ordering, the lossy search-config
  write, the verb-blind POST retry, the one-sided range, the two analysis-status
  defects and the logout credential were fixed with tests. The DeRisi empty
  branch, the doomed auth refresh and half of the FRAME budget item turned out
  not to be defects: the first does not reproduce (871 genes live), the second
  was already fixed and tested, and the third's "partial progress is discarded"
  half was already handled - only its report said otherwise.

  The three heuristics tried against the parameter-resolution benchmark were all
  refuted by it, which is the benchmark doing its job: holding a numeric default
  back whenever the request mentions a number costs 14 correct answers to save
  2, and grouping the ends of a range costs 7 to save none. What shipped is the
  one form that scored at parity on exact and one better on wrong.

  `SILENT` is at zero unenforced again, 30 of 31, having been reopened by the
  five site-model rules the phyletic research added.

* **The wire protocol got a consumer, and the consumer got a suite that fails
  when the page changes.** `@pathfinder/assistant-client` is built from
  `PROTOCOL.md` and not from the app it replaces: a dependency-free core that
  reads the frames section 3 defines, refuses the shapes it does not, resumes on
  the cursor rule of section 4 and reduces a turn by the rules of section 9;
  one module that subclasses the AI SDK's transport, because `useChat` takes a
  class; and one named `legacy`, because the durable-task endpoint frames a
  third shape the protocol tells a client to reject. The app deleted five
  modules and imports them instead, so there is one reduction and one framer in
  the repository rather than two.

  The gate is a generator and a comparison, and it was measured rather than
  asserted: adding one row to the document's chunk table failed the sync test
  with `+ "checkpoint"`, and regenerating the capture then failed the reducer
  test with the same word. A protocol change now has two ways to be caught and
  no way to be silent.

  Three things the port found, all of them in code that was passing its own
  tests. A chunk kind the SDK's schema did not know killed the whole turn,
  which is exactly what section 10's additive rule exists to prevent - the
  client now drops what its protocol version does not define and hands the rest
  on. The snapshot reader knew one of the three log envelopes, so a
  `system-message` or `assistant-message` row would have reached a reducer that
  had no place for it. And the cursor advanced only at turn boundaries for a
  reason that lived in a comment; it is now a function with a name and a test
  that says a mid-turn cursor names a chunk whose `start` the client would not
  have.
