# Backlog

Everything known to be outstanding, ranked by what actually moves the product. Each item stands alone: a fresh session should be able to pick one up without this conversation.

Items are removed when done, not marked done. The [log](../log.md) records
what left.

## Ranked

1. [replace_subtree can destroy the strategy](replace-subtree-can-destroy-the-strategy.md) - a recovery pass halved a correct 16-step tree and left `__input_step__` placeholders; the edit path's leaf-set invariant is missing here.
2. [The combination check under-enforces three or more terms](combination-lca-under-enforces-many-terms.md) - two-term constraints are exact; "A OR B OR C" accepts a tree that ANDs two branches.

## Known and accepted

Not backlog. Recorded as decisions because they were chosen, not deferred:

- [build_strategy is not revision-guarded](../decisions/build-strategy-is-not-revision-guarded.md)
- [No faker or msw generation](../decisions/no-faker-or-msw-generation.md)
- [The nested tree stays at the wire boundary](../decisions/nested-tree-at-the-wire-boundary.md)
