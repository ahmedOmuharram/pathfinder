# WDK and PathFinder

Where PathFinder corresponds to WDK, what PathFinder owns outright, and where it diverges
deliberately. These explain; they do not assert. Assertions live in [the rules](../rules/).

- [What corresponds to what](type-correspondence.md) - the four-column map from WDK Java to `wdk-client` to Pydantic to `@pathfinder/shared`, the two splits PathFinder makes that upstream does not, and every empty cell labelled
- [Who is allowed to talk to WDK](layer-ownership.md) - the six import-linter contracts, what each actually forbids, the `services.wdk` seam, and the two things no contract can see
- [Where PathFinder deliberately differs from WDK](deliberate-divergences.md) - nine divergences with the decision that records what was rejected, and the test that keeps a bug from being filed as one
