# A step analysis is a plugin the site model attaches to a search

WDK owns the lifecycle; it does not own the analysis.
[`StepAnalysis`](https://github.com/VEuPathDB/WDK/blob/e534d2e6a5119165e1742c7a9e07a371217ddda5/Model/src/main/java/org/gusdb/wdk/model/analysis/StepAnalysis.java#L8-L24)
is an interface extending `ParameterContainer` - a name, display metadata, a
timeout, an analyzer instance, and a set of parameters exactly like a search's.
The implementations live in the site model, not in WDK, which is why
[sources.md](../sources.md) has to pin a fourth repository to say anything about
what an enrichment result contains ([WDK-ANS-007](../rules/searches-and-answers.md)).

Analyses are declared per question, so the available set is a property of the
step's search. `GET /users/{id}/steps/{stepId}/analysis-types`
[reads them off the step's question](https://github.com/VEuPathDB/WDK/blob/e534d2e6a5119165e1742c7a9e07a371217ddda5/Service/src/main/java/org/gusdb/wdk/service/service/user/StepAnalysisFormService.java#L92-L99).
On 2026-08-10, a `GenesByMolecularWeight` step on plasmodb.org and on
toxodb.org each offered exactly the same three: `go-enrichment`,
`pathway-enrichment`, `word-enrichment`, all reporting `isCacheable: false`.

The list is the summary form -
[`getStepAnalysisTypeJsonWithoutParams`](https://github.com/VEuPathDB/WDK/blob/e534d2e6a5119165e1742c7a9e07a371217ddda5/Service/src/main/java/org/gusdb/wdk/service/formatter/StepAnalysisFormatter.java#L39-L51)
gives `name`, `displayName`, `shortDescription`, `description`,
`releaseVersion`, `customThumbnail`, `isCacheable`, plus `paramNames` and
`groups`, and no parameter documents. Fetch one by name to get those.

# The form endpoint returns defaults you must send back yourself

`GET .../analysis-types/{name}` returns a `{searchData, validation}` envelope,
the same shape as a search document. It is built at `ValidationLevel.DISPLAYABLE`
with `FILL_PARAM_IF_MISSING`
([`getStepAnalysisTypeDataFromName`](https://github.com/VEuPathDB/WDK/blob/e534d2e6a5119165e1742c7a9e07a371217ddda5/Service/src/main/java/org/gusdb/wdk/service/service/user/StepAnalysisFormService.java#L108-L130)),
so every parameter comes back carrying an `initialDisplayValue`. Live on
plasmodb.org, `go-enrichment` reports five parameters:

| Parameter | Type | `initialDisplayValue` |
|---|---|---|
| `organism` | `single-pick-vocabulary` | `Plasmodium falciparum 3D7` |
| `goAssociationsOntologies` | `single-pick-vocabulary` | `Biological Process` |
| `goEvidenceCodes` | `multi-pick-vocabulary` | `["Computed","Curated"]` |
| `goSubset` | `single-pick-vocabulary` | `No` |
| `pValueCutoff` | `number` | `0.05` |

Creation does not use any of them.
[`createStepAnalysis`](https://github.com/VEuPathDB/WDK/blob/e534d2e6a5119165e1742c7a9e07a371217ddda5/Service/src/main/java/org/gusdb/wdk/service/service/user/StepAnalysisInstanceService.java#L117-L155)
builds the form spec at `ValidationLevel.RUNNABLE` with **`FillStrategy.NO_FILL`**.
Posting `{"analysisName":"word-enrichment","parameters":{}}` is a 422 on both
sites, with `byKey` reporting `Cannot be empty.` for every parameter the form
had just supplied a default for. The two levels are the same document read
twice: `DISPLAYABLE` fills, `RUNNABLE` refuses to. Read the form, copy its
values, send them ([WDK-VALID-011](../rules/validation.md)).

Everything about the parameters themselves - the eleven types, the exact string
each puts on the wire, dependent vocabularies - is the search parameter system
unchanged, described in [parameters](parameters.md) and
[dependent parameters and vocabularies](dependent-params-and-vocabularies.md).
The analysis form endpoints mirror the search ones, including
`refreshed-dependent-params`.

# Create, run, poll, fetch - and two of the four are not 200

The four calls, all under `/users/{id}/steps/{stepId}/analyses`:

| Call | Success status | Body |
|---|---|---|
| `POST .../analyses` | 200 | the instance, `status: "CREATED"` |
| `POST .../analyses/{id}/result` | **202** | `{"status": "RUNNING"}` |
| `GET .../analyses/{id}/result/status` | 200 | `{"status": "<ExecutionStatus>"}` |
| `GET .../analyses/{id}/result` | 200, **or 204 with an empty body** | the plugin's JSON plus four keys |

[`runAnalysis`](https://github.com/VEuPathDB/WDK/blob/e534d2e6a5119165e1742c7a9e07a371217ddda5/Service/src/main/java/org/gusdb/wdk/service/service/user/StepAnalysisInstanceService.java#L293-L309)
returns `Response.accepted()`, so the kick-off is a 202 by design and not the
delayed-result sentinel that shares the status code
([WDK-HTTP-003](../rules/auth-and-transport.md)). Its body carries the status
the run reached synchronously, which on both sites was `RUNNING`.

[`getStepAnalysisResult`](https://github.com/VEuPathDB/WDK/blob/e534d2e6a5119165e1742c7a9e07a371217ddda5/Service/src/main/java/org/gusdb/wdk/service/service/user/StepAnalysisInstanceService.java#L258-L285)
returns `Response.noContent()` when there is no execution result, and otherwise
the plugin's own JSON with `contextHash`, `accessToken`, `downloadUrl` and
`propertiesUrl` added. Measured on both sites: fetching the result of a freshly
created instance is `204`, zero bytes, no content type
([WDK-VALID-008](../rules/validation.md)). It is not an empty result; it is not
a result.

[`getStepAnalysisResultStatus`](https://github.com/VEuPathDB/WDK/blob/e534d2e6a5119165e1742c7a9e07a371217ddda5/Service/src/main/java/org/gusdb/wdk/service/service/user/StepAnalysisInstanceService.java#L311-L322)
is the only call that answers "is it done". A full lifecycle on plasmodb.org on
2026-08-10, `word-enrichment` over a 2365-gene step: `GET result` -> 204;
`GET status` -> `CREATED`; `POST result` -> 202 `RUNNING`; `GET status` three
seconds later -> `COMPLETE`; `GET result` -> 200. Identical on toxodb.org.

# Eleven statuses, and six of them mean "run it again"

[`ExecutionStatus`](https://github.com/VEuPathDB/WDK/blob/e534d2e6a5119165e1742c7a9e07a371217ddda5/Model/src/main/java/org/gusdb/wdk/model/user/analysis/ExecutionStatus.java#L3-L14)
carries two booleans per constant, and they are not the same partition:

| Status | `requiresRerun` | `isTerminal` |
|---|---|---|
| `CREATED` | yes | no |
| `STEP_REVISED` | yes | no |
| `INVALID` | no | no |
| `PENDING` | no | no |
| `RUNNING` | no | no |
| `COMPLETE` | no | yes |
| `INTERRUPTED` | yes | yes |
| `ERROR` | yes | yes |
| `EXPIRED` | yes | no |
| `OUT_OF_DATE` | yes | no |
| `UNKNOWN` | no | no |

`isTerminal` means the plugin finished, successfully or not. `requiresRerun`
means re-running **the same instance** is the correct response - WDK resets it
to `PENDING` and re-executes, so there is no need to create a second instance.
Six statuses carry it. `INTERRUPTED` and `ERROR` carry both flags at once,
which is the pair that a client written around "terminal means stop" gets
wrong ([WDK-VALID-009](../rules/validation.md)).

A separate enum,
[`RevisionStatus`](https://github.com/VEuPathDB/WDK/blob/e534d2e6a5119165e1742c7a9e07a371217ddda5/Model/src/main/java/org/gusdb/wdk/model/user/analysis/RevisionStatus.java#L3-L7),
tracks whether the instance has run since its step was last revised:
`STEP_CLEAN`, `NEW`, `STEP_DIRTY`. It is not on the wire; it is what turns into
a `STEP_REVISED` execution status.

# The instance list is two fields, and the instance detail is ten

This asymmetry is easy to miss and it breaks typed clients.
[`getStepAnalysisInstancesJson`](https://github.com/VEuPathDB/WDK/blob/e534d2e6a5119165e1742c7a9e07a371217ddda5/Service/src/main/java/org/gusdb/wdk/service/formatter/StepAnalysisFormatter.java#L84-L95)
emits `analysisId` and `displayName` and nothing else. Confirmed on both sites:
`GET .../analyses` returns `[{"displayName":"Word Enrichment","analysisId":203635253}]`.
The service
[builds the instances at `ValidationLevel.NONE`](https://github.com/VEuPathDB/WDK/blob/e534d2e6a5119165e1742c7a9e07a371217ddda5/Service/src/main/java/org/gusdb/wdk/service/service/user/StepAnalysisInstanceService.java#L172-L181)
for that call, which is consistent: there is nothing in the summary that a
validation could be about.

The single-instance document is
[the full shape](https://github.com/VEuPathDB/WDK/blob/e534d2e6a5119165e1742c7a9e07a371217ddda5/Service/src/main/java/org/gusdb/wdk/service/formatter/StepAnalysisFormatter.java#L53-L82):
`analysisId`, `stepId`, `analysisName`, `displayName`, `shortDescription`,
`description`, `userNotes`, `status`, `parameters`, `validation`. Two notes on
it. The formatter's own javadoc calls the parameter map `formParams`; the code
writes `JsonKeys.PARAMETERS`, so the key is `parameters`. And `userNotes` is
omitted entirely when null, as observed on both sites.

# Where the result shape comes from

Nothing in the result body except four keys is WDK's, and the rest is the
plugin's view model. That is [WDK-ANS-007](../rules/searches-and-answers.md),
which names the three plugins, their column keys, the fact that every value is
a JSON string, and the one column whose key does not match its label. It is not
restated here.

Worth repeating only as a pointer: the response carries `headerRow` and
`headerDescription`, a manifest keyed by exactly the `resultData` keys, so a
client can render an unfamiliar column instead of dropping it.

# Ownership, and the 404 that should have been a 403

All three verbs on `.../analyses/{analysisId}/result` route through
`StepAnalysisLookupMixin.getAnalysis`, which does its ownership check by hand in
two stages: a bad id or a path user who does not own the step is a 404, and a
third party without a matching `accessToken` is a 403. PathFinder can only ever
reach the first stage. The full account, including why that is a consequence of
addressing concrete user ids, is in
[users, auth and sessions](users-auth-and-sessions.md) and is not repeated here.

Confirmed live on both sites on 2026-08-10: `GET .../analyses/999999999/result`
returns **404** `Resource 'step analysis: 999999999' does not exist.`

# What PathFinder runs today

PathFinder uses the analysis surface for one thing: enrichment.
`services/enrichment/parser.py:ANALYSIS_TYPE_MAP` maps five internal analysis
types onto the three WDK plugins - the three GO flavours all resolve to
`go-enrichment` and are separated by the `goAssociationsOntologies` parameter.
The lifecycle in `integrations/veupathdb/strategy_api/analyses.py:run_step_analysis`
is create, run, poll, fetch, preceded by a zero-record standard report to force
the step's answer to be materialised, and `services/enrichment/params.py:extract_default_params`
reads the form document and sends its defaults back, which is the behaviour the
`NO_FILL` rule above requires.

The near frontier is everything else the platform already exposes and PathFinder
does not touch:

- `PATCH .../analyses/{id}` - rename an instance or attach user notes, so a
  researcher can label two enrichments of the same step.
- `DELETE .../analyses/{id}` - PathFinder creates a new instance per run and
  never removes one.
- `GET .../analyses/{id}/resources?path=...` and `.../properties` - the
  `downloadUrl` and `propertiesUrl` already handed back in every result body,
  unused.
- `POST .../analysis-types/{name}/refreshed-dependent-params` and the two
  ontology-term-summary endpoints on the same path - the analysis form has the
  same dependent-parameter machinery as a search, and PathFinder currently reads
  the form once and never refreshes it, which is the same defect class as
  [a dependent vocabulary read without its parents](../../decisions/a-dependent-vocabulary-is-read-under-its-parents.md).
- Non-enrichment plugins. The three seen here are what a transcript search
  offers on these two sites; the set is a property of the question, so a
  different record class can offer a different list and PathFinder assumes it
  cannot.
