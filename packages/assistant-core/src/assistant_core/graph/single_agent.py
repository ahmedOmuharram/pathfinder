"""A turn graph for an assistant that is one agent.

The agent answers the user directly: its text and its tool calls stream to the
client as the turn's message, and the turn's tokens and cost land on the
state. A tool the agent must ask about parks on the state until the user
answers, and a durable tool parks there until the worker answers. The graph
names no phase, no role and no other agent.
